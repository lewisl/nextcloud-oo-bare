# Document Collaboration Solution Research Plan

## Problem Statement

Current OnlyOffice + Digital Ocean deployment is too brittle for production due to:
- UID changes between reboots breaking container permissions
- Linux volume mounting permission resets (not DO-specific)
- Docker complexity creating downstream operational problems
- No reliable automation for post-reboot recovery

## Research Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Find a production-ready document collaboration solution that meets these requirements:
- Real-time co-editing capabilities
- Version history/change tracking
- Private key control (own encryption keys)
- Reliable operation without manual intervention
- Encryption at rest for security

## Research Plan Structure

### Phase 1: OnlyOffice Alternative Deployment Methods
**Research Question:** Are there non-Docker OnlyOffice deployment options that avoid UID/permission issues?

**Areas to Investigate:**
- Native package installations (RPM/DEB) vs Docker
- OnlyOffice Kubernetes deployments with proper volume management
- Bare metal OnlyOffice installations
- OnlyOffice with external database/storage solutions
- Community-maintained deployment scripts/automation

**Success Criteria:** Find deployment method that eliminates Docker UID complexity while maintaining functionality.

### Phase 2: Cloud Provider Analysis
**Research Question:** Do other cloud providers handle volume mounting/permissions better than Digital Ocean?

**Providers to Evaluate:**
- AWS EBS with EC2 (encrypted volumes)
- Google Cloud Persistent Disks with Compute Engine
- Microsoft Azure Managed Disks
- Linode Block Storage
- Vultr Block Storage
- Hetzner Cloud Volumes

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Volume mounting behavior after reboots
- Permission persistence mechanisms
- Encryption at rest support
- Cost comparison
- OnlyOffice deployment compatibility

### Phase 3: Single-Volume Secure Storage Solutions
**Research Question:** What storage architectures eliminate the multi-volume permission complexity?

**Storage Approaches to Research:**
- Encrypted filesystem solutions (LUKS, eCryptfs)
- Database-backed file storage eliminating separate volumes
- Container-native storage solutions (Container Storage Interface)
- Network-attached storage with encryption
- Object storage backends for OnlyOffice

**Focus Areas:**
- Solutions that work with OnlyOffice's architecture
- Encryption at rest capabilities
- Elimination of multi-volume permission coordination

### Phase 4: Alternative Document Collaboration Platforms
**Research Question:** What other platforms meet the real-time editing, version control, and private key requirements?

**Categories to Investigate:**

#### Self-Hosted Open Source
- Nextcloud + OnlyOffice integration
- Collabora Online (LibreOffice-based)
- CryptPad (privacy-focused)
- Etherpad with extensions
- BookStack (wiki-style)
- TiddlyWiki with collaboration plugins

#### Self-Hosted Commercial
- Confluence Server/Data Center
- SharePoint Server
- Box Enterprise
- Dropbox Business with encryption

#### Hybrid/Private Cloud
- Nextcloud Enterprise
- ownCloud Enterprise
- Collabora Enterprise

**Evaluation Matrix:**
- Real-time co-editing capabilities
- Version history/change tracking
- Private key/encryption control
- Deployment complexity
- Operational reliability
- Cost analysis

### Phase 5: OnlyOffice Managed Hosting Analysis
**Research Question:** Is OnlyOffice's own hosting service viable given privacy/sovereignty concerns?

**Investigation Areas:**

#### Company Background Research
- Ownership structure analysis (Russian/Latvian vs Singapore)
- Data center locations and data residency policies
- GDPR/privacy compliance track record
- Historical security incidents or concerns
- Government access/surveillance concerns

#### Service Analysis
- Encryption at rest capabilities
- Client-side encryption options
- Data residency guarantees
- SLA and uptime commitments
- Pricing vs self-hosting costs
- Migration capabilities (lock-in risk)

#### Risk Assessment
- Geopolitical risk factors
- Data sovereignty implications
- Service continuity risks
- Alternative vendor migration paths

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success
- Identify at least 3 viable alternatives to current problematic deployment
- Find solution(s) that eliminate manual post-reboot intervention
- Maintain required security (encryption at rest, private keys)
- Preserve required functionality (real-time editing, version history)

### Secondary Success  
- Reduce operational complexity vs current Docker deployment
- Improve system reliability and predictability
- Maintain or reduce total cost of ownership
- Provide clear migration path from current system

## Research Methodology

### Information Sources
- Official documentation and technical specifications
