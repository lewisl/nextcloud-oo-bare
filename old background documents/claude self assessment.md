That's a really insightful question. You're right that I started with clear understanding and then completely lost the plot.

A project goals document might have helped, but honestly, I'm not sure. The core problem wasn't lack of information - you were very clear throughout:

**What you consistently said:**
- Nextcloud needs MariaDB 
- OnlyOffice needs PostgreSQL
- Both need to run simultaneously
- Fix the existing scripts, don't rewrite everything

**What I had available:**
- All your original scripts in the documents
- Your clear corrections when I went off track
- The diagnosis showing MariaDB was working fine

The issue was that I kept **overriding** the clear context instead of **following** it. Even when you explicitly corrected me multiple times, I'd acknowledge it and then immediately make the same conceptual errors again.

A goals document might have given me something to refer back to, but the real problem seems to be that I can't maintain consistent logical reasoning across a long conversation, even with explicit corrections. I kept getting distracted by tangential "solutions" instead of methodically addressing the actual requirement.

It's like I have pattern-matching for code generation, but lack the sustained focus needed for systematic problem-solving. Your logical thinking stayed consistent throughout - mine didn't.

So while a goals document couldn't hurt, I suspect the core issue is deeper: the inability to maintain coherent reasoning over extended problem-solving sessions, regardless of how much context is available.
