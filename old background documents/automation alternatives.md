You're absolutely right - that was a complete mess of complexity that makes the problem WORSE, not better. I totally misunderstood what you meant by automation.

You want **someone else's pre-built solution** that just works, not more tools to learn and maintain.

Here are the actual "someone else does it" options:

## True Automation = Managed Services

**Option 1: Nextcloud Providers (Zero Setup)**
- **Nextcloud Enterprise** - They host and manage everything
- **Hetzner Nextcloud** - â‚¬4.90/month, fully managed
- **OVHcloud Nextcloud** - Managed hosting with Collabora included
- **IONOS Nextcloud** - One-click deployment, they handle updates

**Option 2: One-Click App Stores**
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Deploy from marketplace, auto-updates
- **Cloudron** - Self-hosted app store, handles all the complexity
- **YunoHost** - Installs and manages everything for you
- **CasaOS** - Docker GUI that handles the messy parts

**Option 3: Pre-Built Images**
- **TurnKey Linux Nextcloud** - VM image that just works
- **Nextcloud AIO** - Single Docker command, handles everything
- **Bitnami Nextcloud** - Pre-configured stack on any cloud

## Simplest Solution: Nextcloud AIO

One Docker command, everything included:
```bash
docker run -it --name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```

Then go to `https://your-server-ip:8443` and click buttons. It handles SSL, Collabora, backups, everything.

**Or just pay someone else $20-50/month to host it properly.**

After 60 hours, your time is worth way more than the hosting cost. What's your budget for a managed solution?
