**You**:

how do I deploy an Augment code agent in an ssh session? where does it display responses and ask for my input?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Short version: you’ve got two ways.

## A) Run it **inside your SSH session** (Auggie CLI)

- On the remote box (the one you SSH into), install Node 22+ and Auggie:

bash`# if you use nvm: nvm install 22 && nvm use 22
npm install -g @augmentcode/auggie
`</pre>

Auggie requires Node 22+. [Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/product/CLI)

- In the repo folder, sign in and start the agent:

bash`cd /path/to/repo
auggie --login
auggie          # interactive TUI
`</pre>

- **Where do responses/input appear?** Right in that SSH terminal. `auggie` opens a full-screen interactive UI that streams output, shows tool calls, and lets you type replies in the same window. For one-shot/non-interactive runs, use `auggie --print "do X"` (and optionally `--quiet`). [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview)

## B) Use **Remote Agent** (Augment’s cloud VM) and SSH _to it_

- You create a Remote Agent from Augment’s VS Code panel (connect GitHub so it can clone/PR). When you need a shell, click **“SSH to agent”** in the Remote Agent dashboard—VS Code opens a remote window into that VM. Your chat/responses live in the Augment panel, not in a headless SSH TTY. The SSH window is just a normal shell for running commands. [Augment+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/using-augment/remote-agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you specifically want a pure SSH workflow with prompts/answers inside the terminal you’re logged into, pick **Auggie CLI**. If you want Augment to run in its own cloud environment and you occasionally drop in via SSH, pick **Remote Agent**. [Augment+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview)

If you want, tell me which OS the remote box is running and I’ll paste the exact Node 22 install steps for that machine.

---

**You**:

is a repo required for the code being created if it is all new code?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Short answer: **it depends on which Augment “agent” you’re using.**

- **Auggie CLI (inside your SSH session):****
**No repo required.** You can run `auggie` in an empty folder and have it scaffold files there. Git is optional—but recommended so you can diff/undo its edits. Auggie indexes “your project directory” and can read/write files and run commands locally. [Augment+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview)

- **Remote Agent (Augment’s cloud VM):****
**Yes, a GitHub repository is required.** Remote Agents attach to a repo, clone it, work on a branch, and open PRs. For brand-new code, create an empty repo (even just a README), then point Remote Agent at it. [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/using-augment/remote-agent)

If you want to start totally from scratch over SSH, do this:

bash`mkdir new-project && cd new-project
# optional but wise:
git init && git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: init"
auggie
`</pre>

That gives you a clean local workspace (with or without git) where Auggie can generate the initial code, and you can push to a remote later if you choose. [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview)

---

**You**:

the project will create bash scripts.  My local machine contains background markdown documents and early versions of the code. the code must run on a remote server. and augment must examine the state of deploying several large applications on the remote server. This suggests I should have a clone of the repo on my local machine and their should be a clone on the server while origin iscon the target server. but this introducesa lot of complexity. augment must commit changes during development to the server clone of the repo. then push to git. and I pull from git. this makes it hard for me to contribute my own changes: I must commit on my machine; push to git; and augment must then pull from git. is there another approach that makes exploratory development more fluid?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Yep—there’s a much smoother way: make the **server** the single source of truth and let both you _and_ Augment work in that **same working tree**.

# Recommended workflow (most fluid)

**Run Auggie CLI on the server, edit the server’s files from your laptop.****
That way Auggie can inspect the live environment, run checks, and write scripts right where they’ll be executed—no push/pull ping-pong.

- **On the server (canonical working copy)**

bash`# 0) Optional: keep Auggie alive with tmux
tmux new -s aug

# 1) Project home
mkdir -p /srv/aug-project && cd /srv/aug-project
git init
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: init"

# 2) Install Auggie CLI (needs Node.js)
npm install -g @augmentcode/auggie
auggie --login
auggie  # launches the interactive TUI inside your SSH session
`</pre>

- Auggie’s interactive UI streams output and takes your input **in that terminal**. [Augment+2Augment+2](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **From your laptop (no more juggling clones)**

- Open the **same folder on the server** with VS Code Remote-SSH (or just vim/helix over SSH) and edit normally. You and Auggie are touching the **same files**, so there’s no “you push → it pulls” loop.

- If you prefer a GUI editor but hate copying files around, VS Code Remote-SSH gives you a local-feeling editor on the remote FS. (Augment’s docs use Remote-SSH for their own Remote Agent too.) [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/using-augment/remote-agent)

- **Bring your background docs in****
You said they live on your laptop. Keep it light:

bash`# from your laptop — one-liner to sync notes into the server repo
rsync -avz --delete ~/Notes/aug-project/ user@server:/srv/aug-project/docs/
`</pre>

Now Auggie can read those markdowns because they’re in the server working tree.

- **Git without the churn**

- Do small commits from the server as you/auggie iterate:

bash`git add -A && git commit -m "wip: scaffold deploy scripts"
`</pre>

- When you want history/backup, add a remote **once** and push:

bash`git remote add origin <github-or-git-server-url>
git push -u origin main
`</pre>

- If you want to keep “agent noise” separate, have Auggie commit to a branch like `agent/auggie`, and you work on `main`; periodically `git merge --squash agent/auggie`.

Why this beats two clones + central origin

- **Zero push/pull dance while exploring.** You and Auggie share one working directory.

- **Reality-based automation.** Auggie is literally on the box that runs the apps, so “check docker status”, “scan systemd units”, “tail logs”, etc., all just work.

- **Less merge hell.** No constant cross-pulls between your laptop and the server; you only push when you’re ready.

# Variations (if you really want them)

- **Near-real-time sync instead of editing remote:** use a dev sync tool (e.g., Mutagen or Syncthing) to mirror your laptop folder ↔ `/srv/aug-project`. Auggie still runs on the server. This is nice offline, but it re-introduces sync rules/conflicts you said you dislike.

- **Bare repo + auto-deploy hook:** make `/srv/git/aug-project.git` (bare), push from laptop, and use a `post-receive` hook to update `/srv/aug-project`. Auggie works in the working tree. This is clean but more DevOps glue.

- **Remote Agent (Augment cloud):** great for PR-driven work, but it clones a **GitHub repo** in Augment’s cloud and you **SSH into that VM via VS Code**. It’s not ideal for inspecting your production server unless you also wire in SSH/MCP tools. For your “poke the target box” requirement, Auggie on the target server is simpler. [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/using-augment/remote-agent)

# Quick hardening tips

- Create a `deploy` user; give narrowly scoped `sudo` (or none).

- Run Auggie inside `tmux` so it survives disconnects.

- Add a pre-commit hook for shellcheck/shfmt so all agent-written Bash meets your bar.

If you want, I’ll paste a ready-to-run setup script that:

- installs Node 22 + Auggie on Ubuntu/Debian,

- creates the project dir, git init, shellcheck/shfmt pre-commit,

- and drops a couple of `rsync` aliases for your notes.

---

**You**:

I like your recommended approach. just wondering how auggie/augment can also see the local project documents. I suppose I can just upload them to the working project directory on the server with sftp

---

**ChatGPT**:

SFTP works fine for a one-off upload. If you’ll be updating those docs repeatedly, use one of these smoother options so Auggie can always “see” them on the server:

## Easiest: one-way `rsync` (recommended)

Treat your **laptop copy as canonical** and push into the server’s project tree (e.g., `/srv/aug-project/docs/`), so Auggie can read them there.

bash`# dry run first (shows what will change)
rsync -avzn --delete \
  --exclude ".DS_Store" \
  ~/Notes/aug-project/  user@server:/srv/aug-project/docs/

# then do it for real
rsync -avz --delete \
  --exclude ".DS_Store" \
  ~/Notes/aug-project/  user@server:/srv/aug-project/docs/
`</pre>

Tips:

- Put `docs/` under the same repo root so Auggie indexes it naturally.

- If you don’t want docs in Git, add `docs/` to `.gitignore` (Auggie can still read them from disk).

- Run Auggie in `tmux` and sync any time—no restarts needed.

## “Feels local”: edit remote files directly

Open `/srv/aug-project` via **VS Code Remote-SSH** (or just use vim over SSH). You can drag-drop your local docs into `docs/` and edit everything in place. No extra tooling, no sync conflicts.

## Continuous sync (only if you really want it)

- **Mutagen** (simple, robust) or **Syncthing** (more knobs) can keep `~/Notes/aug-project` ↔ `/srv/aug-project/docs/` mirrored. Handy if you’re constantly editing notes, but adds moving parts.

## Keep history separate (optional)

If you want docs versioned independently but still visible to Auggie:

- Use a **git subtree**:

bash`# on the server, inside /srv/aug-project
git remote add notes <your-notes-repo-url>
git subtree add --prefix=docs notes main --squash
`</pre>

You retain a clean code history but the files physically live in `docs/`.

**Bottom line:** put the docs inside the server’s project directory so Auggie can read them; use `rsync` for painless repeat updates, or edit remotely via VS Code Remote-SSH if you prefer “live” edits.

---

**You**:

Really my situation is even more complicated than described and I wonder if there is a better approach.

1. I have a working deployment of the system installed with cloudron at docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org.  this is meant to be production but right now there is no production use so no data will be lost.  this is the reference implementation because it is one of the few ways to get the entire system to work. However, there are aspects of this deployment that are undesirable so the goal is to create a bare metal (preferred) or docker (with no cloudron) installation that can be installed with scripts.
2. I have a test site at test-collab-site.com which is meant to be the test site.  Augment assumed it could copy a deployment from one domain to another but that is probably impossible or very error prone because domain names will be hard coded into the deployment, in nginx config files and in some parameters of NextCloud.  For nginx, the domain names could be set in environment variables, but not for NextCloud internal parameters.  

It seems reasonable that Augment should have access to both servers to inspect and make changes at the test site.  And Augment should have access to the project files including a src and docs directory that it can change as well as some reference material including project documents and an earlier attempt at scripts (which failed).  the project is both a local repo on my laptop and a github repo.  

with this background what is the best setup?  Here are some specific questions:

a) should I clone the repo on the test site?
b) instead of Augment remote agents or running Auggie in either or both of the servers, I could use Visual Studio Code as a "bridge" across everything:
- open an ssh session in one VS Code terminal to the "production" server
- open a 2nd ssh session in another VS Code interal terminal to the test server
- open the project as the working folder in VS Code

This would mean that Augment is working "locally" to the VS Code instance on my laptop but has access to everything on both servers via the terminal sessions and has access to the project background documents and the code it is going to write.

How does option b here compare to the remote agents or Auggie you have proposed?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Great context—here’s a setup that stays fluid, lets Augment see both machines, and avoids the push/pull merry-go-round.

# TL;DR

- **Clone the repo on the _test_ server and treat that working tree as the canonical place where code actually runs and evolves.** Yes to (a). [Augment Code+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Run Auggie (CLI) on the _test_ server** so it can read/write the real files and inspect services there directly. You edit the same files from your laptop via VS Code Remote-SSH. [Augment Code+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Keep Cloudron “prod” **read-only for discovery** (logs, configs) until your bare-metal/docker scripts are solid.

- **Avoid domain copying.** For Nextcloud, reconfigure per-domain via `config.php`/`occ` and template Nginx with `envsubst` instead of hardcoding hostnames. [Nextcloud](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Nextcloud community](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/overwrite-cli-url-warning-given-even-though-overwrite-cli-url-is-correctly-set/158610?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Baeldung on Kotlin](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/nginx-config-environment-variables?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/577370/how-can-i-use-environment-variables-in-nginx-conf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Recommended architecture

### 1) Test server = single source of truth

- Clone the repo **on the test server** (answer to (a): **yes**), and run **Auggie** there in a `tmux` session. It will index the project and can run checks, edit scripts, tail logs, and call system tools **in the same filesystem** it’s changing. [Augment Code+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- From your laptop, open that folder with **VS Code Remote-SSH** so you and Auggie are literally looking at the same files. (You’ll install the VS Code Remote-SSH extension; open folder on the server; now your editor “feels local,” but it’s actually remote.) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Why this is fluid:

- No “you push → agent pulls” loop.

- Auggie’s shell commands and file edits happen **where the services run** (docker, systemd, nginx, nextcloud’s `occ`, etc.), so diagnosis is accurate.

### 2) Cloudron “prod” = reference only (for now)

- Give yourself (and optionally Auggie) **read-only** SSH to prod to **inspect** configs/logs and diff against the test machine. Hold off on write operations there until your scripted install works.

### 3) Domains & config strategy (don’t clone installs across domains)

Copying a full Nextcloud/stack from one domain to another is fragile because domain appears in multiple places. Prefer **fresh install + scripted configuration**:

- **Nextcloud:** set domain-specific values via config and `occ`, e.g.

- `trusted_domains` (array) and `overwrite.cli.url`; optionally `overwritehost/overwriteprotocol` behind proxies. [Nextcloud](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Don’t assume only one knob—several users hit issues if only `overwrite.cli.url` is changed. (Community guidance highlights this; test after each change.) [Nextcloud community+1](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/changing-overwrite-cli-url-has-no-effect/211614?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Nginx:** don’t hardcode FQDNs in static _.conf_. Use a **template + envsubst** (e.g., `server_name ${SITE_DOMAIN};`) at startup or during deploy. Nginx doesn’t read arbitrary env vars in config directly; `envsubst` is the standard pattern. [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/577370/how-can-i-use-environment-variables-in-nginx-conf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Baeldung on Kotlin](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/nginx-config-environment-variables?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

This lets your scripts take `SITE_DOMAIN=test-collab-site.com` (or the Cloudron hostname) and render the right config for each server.

## Concretely, how to wire it

**On the test server**

bash`sudo apt-get update
# Node 22+ for Auggie; then:
npm install -g @augmentcode/auggie
mkdir -p /srv/collab && cd /srv/collab
git clone <your-repo-url> .   # or git init if starting fresh
tmux new -s aug && auggie --login && auggie
`</pre>

(Auggie runs in that SSH TUI; your input/output are in the same terminal.) [Augment Code+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/setup-auggie/install-auggie-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**From your laptop**

- **Open VS Code → Remote-SSH →** connect to the test server and open `/srv/collab`. You now edit the exact files Auggie is touching; no syncing gymnastics. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Repo hygiene**

- Commit frequently on the test server; push to GitHub when you want backup/review. Optionally keep an `agent/` branch for Auggie’s WIP and merge/squash into `main`.

**Docs/background on your laptop**

- Keep them visible to Auggie by placing them _under the remote project tree_ (`/srv/collab/docs/`). Use one-way `rsync` from laptop → server when they change:

bash`rsync -avz --delete ~/Notes/collab/ user@test:/srv/collab/docs/
`</pre>

(If you don’t want docs in git, add `docs/` to `.gitignore`; Auggie can still read them from disk.)

## About option (b): local VS Code as a “bridge” with two SSH terminals

You _can_ do it, but here are the trade-offs:

- When Augment runs inside **local** VS Code, its file index is your **local workspace**, not the remote servers—unless you actually open a **Remote-SSH workspace** (which then makes the remote filesystem the workspace). Otherwise, Augment can’t “see” `/etc/nginx/*.conf` or Nextcloud config on the server without you hand-feeding it. [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/workspace-indexing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Commands the agent executes will run **on your laptop** unless you wrap them with `ssh user@host ...`. It can’t magically “use” the two interactive terminals you opened—it launches its own processes. That adds quoting/TTY/SSH-auth friction and makes long-running inspections brittle. (Community reports also show rough edges when mixing Augment + Remote-SSH unless you install things correctly on the remote side.) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1m18sny/cant_use_augmentcode_vs_extension_in_vs_code_ssh/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Net:** Option (b) works for light tasks, but for your scenario—system inspection, multiple services, Nginx/Nextcloud edits—the **Auggie-on-test-server** pattern is far more robust and keeps the loop tight.

## Minimal domain-aware scaffolding to add now

- `env/test.env` and `env/prod.env` (values like `SITE_DOMAIN`, `NEXTCLOUD_URL`, etc).

- `deploy/render-nginx.sh`:

bash`#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${SITE_DOMAIN:?SITE_DOMAIN required}"
envsubst < deploy/nginx/site.conf.tmpl > /etc/nginx/conf.d/site.conf
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
`</pre>

[Baeldung on Kotlin](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/nginx-config-environment-variables?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- `deploy/nextcloud-config.sh`:

bash`#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${NEXTCLOUD_PATH:?}"; : "${NEXTCLOUD_URL:?}"
sudo -u www-data php "$NEXTCLOUD_PATH/occ" config:system:set trusted_domains 0 --value="$(echo "$NEXTCLOUD_URL" | sed 's~https\?://~~;s~/.*~~')"
sudo -u www-data php "$NEXTCLOUD_PATH/occ" config:system:set overwrite.cli.url --value="$NEXTCLOUD_URL"
`</pre>

(Extend for `overwritehost`, `overwriteprotocol`, proxies as needed.) [Nextcloud](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Final answers to your questions

**a) Clone the repo on the test site?****
**Yes.** Make that working tree the canonical place where Auggie runs and where scripts are executed and verified. Push to GitHub for backup/review. [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**b) Local VS Code “bridge” vs Remote Agents/Auggie?**

- **Best for you:** **Auggie on the test server** + VS Code Remote-SSH. You and the agent share the same files; the agent can inspect/rerun services on the spot. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Remote Agents** are great for cloud PR-driven work but are less direct for poking your own servers unless you wire in extra access. [Augment Code+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/using-augment/remote-agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Local VS Code bridge** works, but you’ll spend more time tunneling commands (`ssh`, `rsync`) and less time shipping.

If you want, I can draft the repo layout (`deploy/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, templated Nginx, Nextcloud `occ` steps) so Auggie can start from that scaffold on the test box.

---

**You**:

Before I go and configure this, I would absolutely ssh to make the remote server the workspace.  that is easy.  then Augment working "locally" would actually be working on the server. this does depend on my laptop and vs code maintaining a reliable internet connection, which is generally possible.

But, is this better or worse than Auggie, which is a beta, running at the test server?

And, do I have to use tmux: I am not a tmux user at all. I have a local ssh login via terminal to see what is going on, but once auggie is working does it need a terminal, per se?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Great questions—here’s the practical breakdown.

## Which is better for your case?

**VS Code Remote-SSH workspace (Augment “local” in that window) vs. Auggie on the test server**

- **Reliability when your laptop drops connection**

- **Remote-SSH only:** your editor and any terminals die with the SSH session. You can reconnect quickly, but any _interactive_ tool you were running stops.

- **Auggie on server (under a multiplexer):** keeps running on the box even if you disconnect; you just reattach.

- **System inspection & script execution**

- **Both** can edit the same remote files and run commands on the test box.

- **Auggie on server** is simplest for “look at services, tail logs, run `occ`, tweak nginx, rerun”—because the agent’s _own_ processes live there.

- **Maturity**

- The VS Code flow uses tooling you already know; no new habits.

- Auggie is newer, but its big win here is resilience + colocation.

**My recommendation for your scenario:****
Use **Auggie on the test server** for the heavy, iterative work (since it needs to poke the machine a lot), and edit the same tree via **VS Code Remote-SSH**. That gives you fluid edits _and_ a long-lived agent session that survives your Wi-Fi hiccups.

## Do you have to use `tmux`?

**No—but it’s the easiest way to keep Auggie alive.****
Auggie’s interactive UI needs a TTY. If you close the SSH window, the process ends unless you:

- run it inside **tmux**/**screen** (recommended), or

- run a non-interactive/batch mode (less useful for back-and-forth), or

- wrap it as a **systemd** service (awkward for an interactive TUI).

If you’re tmux-averse, here’s a **90-second tmux “only what you need”**:

bash`# start or attach to a session named "aug"
tmux new -As aug

# (inside Aug session) start auggie
auggie   # interactive UI runs here

# detach (leave it running)  -> press:  Ctrl-b  then  d
# reattach later
tmux attach -t aug

# kill the session when done (from outside tmux)
tmux kill-session -t aug
`</pre>

That’s it—two commands and one key combo.

### If you truly don’t want tmux

- Use **mosh** for more forgiving roaming; still, if your laptop sleeps long enough, the process can die.

- Or run Auggie only when you’re actively there, knowing it will exit on disconnect.

- Or run Auggie inside **screen** (similar to tmux, slightly simpler keys).

## If you stick with “Remote-SSH only”

Totally workable, just set keep-alives so the connection is sticky:

`~/.ssh/config`

pgsql`Host test-server
  HostName <ip-or-name>
  User <you>
  ServerAliveInterval 30
  ServerAliveCountMax 3
`</pre>

Then open the remote folder in VS Code (Remote-SSH), use the integrated terminal for commands, and launch Augment inside that environment. Just remember: if the window dies, your interactive processes die too.

## Bottom line

- **Best blend:** Auggie on the **test server** (inside tmux) + **VS Code Remote-SSH** for editing the same files.

- **tmux isn’t mandatory,** but it’s the one tiny tool that makes long interactive sessions robust. If you only learn `new -As aug`, `Ctrl-b d`, and `attach -t aug`, you’ve learned enough.

---

**You**:

so, this stuff gets confusing in terms of what is running where.  Should I install tmux on the server or on my local laptop so I can use tmux in the macOS terminal?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Install **tmux on the server**.

Reason: tmux only keeps _processes on the same machine_ alive when your SSH/VScode window drops. If you run Auggie on the **test server**, you want tmux **there** so Auggie keeps running after disconnects. A tmux session on your Mac won’t help a process that’s running on the server.

Quick setup:

**On the server**

bash`# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y tmux
# RHEL/Fedora
sudo dnf install -y tmux
# Arch
sudo pacman -S tmux
# Alpine
sudo apk add tmux
`</pre>

**Use it (only 3 things to remember)**

bash`tmux new -As aug   # start or attach session "aug"
auggie             # run the agent inside tmux
# detach but keep it running:
# press  Ctrl-b  then  d
tmux attach -t aug # reattach later
`</pre>

Optional: you _can_ also install tmux on your Mac for your own local workflows, but it’s unrelated to keeping the remote Auggie alive.

Tip: using **VS Code Remote-SSH** + starting **tmux on the server** in the integrated terminal is perfectly fine (tmux inside VS Code’s terminal). If you really hate tmux, you can try **screen** instead—but some multiplexer is the simplest way to keep an interactive Auggie session resilient.

---

**You**:

So, auggie will communicate with me through the interface it creates (curses?) within the terminal that is connected via ssh to the test server?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Yes—exactly.

When you SSH into the **test server** and run `auggie` there, it opens a **full-screen terminal UI (TUI)** _inside that same SSH terminal_. That’s where you’ll see the agent’s streaming responses, tool runs, and prompts, and it’s where you type your replies. It works fine in:

- a normal SSH terminal,

- the VS Code Remote-SSH integrated terminal,

- or inside `tmux`/`screen` (recommended so it survives disconnects).

Quick flow:

bash`ssh user@test-server
tmux new -As aug      # optional but recommended
auggie --login        # first time only
auggie                # launches the interactive TUI in this terminal
# detach (keep running):  Ctrl-b  then  d
# reattach later:         tmux attach -t aug
`</pre>

Notes:

- If you close the SSH window without `tmux`/`screen`, the interactive session ends. With `tmux`, it keeps running and you can reattach.

- Need a one-shot, non-interactive run? Use:

bash`auggie --print "describe the current nginx vhosts and suggest fixes"
`</pre>

That prints to stdout and exits—handy for scripts or CI.

So: run Auggie on the server; talk to it right in that SSH terminal; use `tmux` only to keep it alive between disconnects.

---

**You**:

ok.  is TUI some more modern thing than curses?  (doesn't matter--just curious--I get whatever auggie does...)

---

**ChatGPT**:

Short answer: **“TUI” is the concept; “curses” is one way to build it.**

- **TUI** = Terminal (Text) User Interface—any full-screen UI that runs in a terminal (panels, keybindings, colors, etc.).

- **curses/ncurses** = a specific library/APIs used by many TUIs to draw boxes, handle keys, etc. Lots of modern TUIs still use **ncurses**, while others talk to the terminal directly with ANSI escape codes or use newer libs (e.g., notcurses, blessed, prompt_toolkit, tcell, Textual, Bubble Tea).

So a TUI isn’t “newer than curses”—it’s the umbrella term. Auggie presents a TUI; under the hood it may or may not use ncurses, but either way it behaves the same in your SSH terminal.

Tiny pro tips for nice rendering over SSH/tmux:

bash`echo $TERM          # aim for xterm-256color (or tmux-256color inside tmux)
locale              # ensure a UTF-8 locale, e.g., en_US.UTF-8
`</pre>

If colors/lines look odd inside tmux:

bash`export TERM=tmux-256color
# and install terminfo if needed: sudo apt-get install ncurses-term
`</pre>

**You**:

pacman and apk not present on the server:

0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 13 not upgraded.
sudo: dnf: command not found
sudo: pacman: command not found
sudo: apk: command not found

---

**ChatGPT**:

Right—those package managers are for other distros. Your server clearly has **apt**, so it’s Debian/Ubuntu. Do this:

bash`# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tmux
tmux -V   # sanity check
`</pre>

If you somehow get “package not found,” enable Universe (Ubuntu only) and try again:

bash`sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y tmux
`</pre>

Quick use (just the essentials):

bash`tmux new -As aug   # start/attach session named "aug"
auggie             # run the agent inside
# detach but keep it running:  Ctrl-b then d
tmux attach -t aug # reattach later
`</pre>

(For RHEL/CentOS you’d use `yum/dnf`; Arch uses `pacman`; Alpine uses `apk`—but you don’t need those here.)

---

**You**:

auggie appears to be running in a tmux session.  how do I get it to do something to see if it is alive

---

**ChatGPT**:

Yep—if you see the Auggie TUI in that tmux window, just type an instruction in its input box and hit Enter. Three quick “is it alive?” pokes:

- **Pure chat (no tools):****
Type: `Reply only with PONG.`**
—You should see a streamed reply “PONG”. [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview)

- **Run a safe shell command:****
Type: `Run "uname -a" and show me the output.`**
—If tool permissions are in “ask” mode, you’ll get an approval prompt in the TUI; allow it once and you’ll see the command result inline. [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/permissions)

- **Read a file:****
Type: `Open /etc/os-release and print PRETTY_NAME.`**
—This exercises the file-view tool (and proves it can see the server’s FS). [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/permissions)

If you’d rather test from a _non-interactive_ shell (outside the TUI), you can run one-shots like:

bash`auggie --print "Return only the word PONG."
`</pre>

(That prints once and exits.) Add `--quiet` to suppress intermediate steps. [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/reference)

### If a shell call is blocked

You can allow just a few safe commands by dropping a minimal policy in your project root:

bash`mkdir -p .augment
cat > .augment/settings.json <<'JSON'
{
  "tool-permissions": [
    { "tool-name": "launch-process",
      "shell-input-regex": "^(pwd|ls|cat|grep|echo|uname)(\\s|$)",
      "permission": { "type": "allow" } },
    { "tool-name": "view", "permission": { "type": "allow" } }
  ]
}
JSON
`</pre>

(You’ll still get prompts for anything not matched.) [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/permissions)

Handy flags you can try anytime:

- `auggie --help`, `auggie --version`, `auggie --list-models`

- `auggie --print "Summarize the files in this directory"` (one-shot) [Augment Code](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/reference)

If any of those respond, Auggie’s alive and talking to you in that tmux’d SSH terminal.

Node.js v18.19.1
root@test-collab:/srv/collab#

---

**ChatGPT**:

You’re on **Node v18.19.1**, but Auggie requires **Node 22+**. That `ReferenceError: crypto is not defined` is a classic symptom—Auggie expects the modern Web Crypto in Node ≥20/22; Node 18 won’t cut it. Update Node, then re-run login. [Augment Code+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/setup-auggie/install-auggie-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/changelog?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Fix (Debian/Ubuntu with apt)

**Option A — NodeSource (simple, system-wide)**

bash`# as root or with sudo
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
node -v     # should print v22.x
npm -v
npm i -g @augmentcode/auggie
auggie --login
`</pre>

(NodeSource provides current LTS packages for Debian/Ubuntu.) [deb.nodesource.com](https://deb.nodesource.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Option B — nvm (per-user, avoids global sudo npm)**

bash`# run as your non-root user (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
nvm install 22
node -v
npm i -g @augmentcode/auggie
auggie --login
`</pre>

(nvm lets you switch Node versions without touching system packages.) [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1502744/how-to-install-node-js-latest-version-on-ubuntu-22-04?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Quick sanity checks

bash`which node
node -v
node -p "!!globalThis.crypto && !!globalThis.crypto.subtle"  # should print true on Node 22
auggie --version
`</pre>

## tmux note

If Auggie is running in tmux right now, **exit the TUI and restart it** after the Node upgrade so it picks up the new runtime:

bash`# inside tmux
exit   # or Ctrl-C to quit Auggie
# then relaunch
tmux new -As aug
auggie --login
`</pre>

If anything still complains, paste the new `node -v` and `auggie --version` and I’ll zero in.

---

**You**:

I have everfything working.  very confusing.  starting tmux and then logging into augment is a bit burdensome. so be it.

when I starting working, do I work through the terminal session with all my prompts?  can the augment client in vs code "see" what auggie is doing and provide a better ui? I understand how great it is for the agent to see the state of the server and see and assess responses to the code it runs (saves huge delays of cut/paste and assess).  But the ui itself is really primitive and doesn't allow history to be trivially examined by just scrolling...

---

**ChatGPT**:

You’ve got it working—nice. Here’s the cleanest way to think about the UI pieces and how to make the terminal experience less painful.

## Where to type / which UI?

- **Auggie (CLI) on the server**: you talk to it in the same SSH terminal where you launched `auggie`. That full-screen TUI is _the_ interface for that process. There isn’t (today) a way for the **VS Code Augment panel** to “attach” to a running Auggie session—the IDE extension and the CLI are separate front-ends. Use one or the other per task. [Augment+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=augment.vscode-augment&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **VS Code Augment panel (Remote-SSH workspace)**: if you open the _server folder_ via Remote-SSH, the Augment panel runs against that remote workspace and gives you a nicer chat/history UI—**but** it won’t show what your _separate_ Auggie TUI session is doing. If you want a pretty UI, run everything through the panel and skip the TUI for that session. [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/quickstart?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Remote Agents (Augment cloud)**: good if you want a UI you can monitor from VS Code and agents that keep running when your laptop sleeps, but those run in Augment’s VM—not on your test box—unless you wire in SSH tools. For “inspect the actual server,” Auggie on the server stays simpler. [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/using-augment/remote-agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Make the TUI livable (tmux tweaks that help a lot)

Add a tiny `~/.tmux.conf` on the **server**:

tmux`set -g mouse on
set -g history-limit 100000
`</pre>

Then start a fresh session (`tmux new -As aug`). You can now scroll with the mouse or PgUp, and you’ll have big scrollback. [Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/210125/scroll-shell-output-with-mouse-in-tmux?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Medium](https://medium.com/%40bhavik.n/customize-tmux-to-use-it-effectively-28b262c8b692?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43414/unlimited-history-in-tmux?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Quick tmux soup-to-nuts (only what you need)

bash`tmux new -As aug   # start/attach session "aug"
auggie             # run the agent TUI here
# detach (keep it running):  Ctrl-b  then  d
tmux attach -t aug # reattach later
`</pre>

### Capture history when you need it

If you want a text snapshot of what’s on screen / in scrollback:

bash`tmux capture-pane -p -S -100000 -t aug > ~/auggie-$(date +%F-%H%M).txt
`</pre>

That dumps up to 100k lines from the Auggie pane to a file you can search. [Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43414/unlimited-history-in-tmux?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## When to prefer each UI

- **Use Auggie TUI** when resilience matters (you’ll roam/disconnect) and you’re running lots of shell/service checks directly on the box. It’s the most reliable “lives on the server” loop. [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Use the VS Code panel (Remote-SSH)** when you want nicer conversation history, clickable diffs, etc.—and you’re okay that the session depends on your editor being connected. [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/quickstart?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Handy CLI one-shots (no TUI)

Even if you mostly live in the panel, you can still fire quick tests in a shell:

bash`auggie --print "List enabled nginx sites and summarize differences"
auggie --quiet --print "Return only the word PONG."
`</pre>

These run once and exit (great for scripts). [Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/reference?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/using-the-auggie-cli-for-automated-code-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you want, I can drop a tiny server-side setup script that:

- installs tmux, writes that `~/.tmux.conf`,

- creates a `tmux auggie` launcher,

- and adds a `dump-auggie-history` helper so you don’t have to remember the capture-pane incantation.

---

**You**:

this is just a mess!!!!!   Do I need 2 connections to the server? the tmux with auggie ui takes over one terminal. so I need my own independent terminal connection to see what is going on at the server, right?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Totally get it—this part feels messy at first.

**Short answer:** you do **not** need two SSH connections. One SSH session + **tmux with multiple windows** is enough. But if you _prefer_ two terminals, that’s fine too.

## The smooth mental model

- One tmux **session** called `aug`

- Window **0**: Auggie TUI (leave it running)

- Window **1**: your regular shell for “seeing what’s going on” (logs, edits, htop, etc.)

- (Optional) Window **2**: tails/monitoring

### Minimal tmux you need

- **Start/attach session:** `tmux new -As aug`

- **New window:** `Ctrl-b  c`

- **Switch windows:** `Ctrl-b  0` / `Ctrl-b  1` (or `Ctrl-b n` / `Ctrl-b p`)

- **Rename window:** `Ctrl-b  ,`

- **Split panes (if you like panes):**

- Vertical: `Ctrl-b  %`

- Horizontal: `Ctrl-b  "`

- **Scrollback:** `Ctrl-b  [` then scroll (or enable mouse)

- **Detach (keep running):** `Ctrl-b  d`

- **Reattach later:** `tmux attach -t aug`

### One-liner to set it up the easy way

This starts Auggie in window 0, makes a clean shell window for you, and drops you in:

bash`tmux new -d -s aug 'auggie' \
  && tmux new-window -t aug -n shell \
  && tmux select-window -t aug:1 \
  && tmux attach -t aug
`</pre>

- Now **window 0** has Auggie; **window 1** is your shell. Flip with `Ctrl-b  0/1`.

### Prefer two terminals?

Go ahead:

- Terminal A: `ssh … && tmux new -As aug` → use **window 0** for Auggie.

- Terminal B: `ssh … && tmux attach -t aug` → hit `Ctrl-b  c` to make **window 1** for your work.**
Both terminals are looking at the **same tmux session**, so nothing dies if one disconnects.

### Make tmux friendlier (2 tiny settings)

On the **server**, add `~/.tmux.conf`:

pgsql`set -g mouse on
set -g history-limit 100000
`</pre>

Then start a fresh tmux (`tmux kill-session -t aug` if needed, then `tmux new -As aug`). Now you can scroll with the mouse and have deep history.

**Bottom line:** You can keep everything in a single SSH connection by using tmux windows. Open a clean window for your shell, leave Auggie running in its own window, and hop between them. If you like having two macOS Terminal tabs, that works too—just attach both to the same `aug` session.

---

**You**:

what is window 1?  it hasn't been started yet.  this is why I hate tumx.  it's all invisible

---

**ChatGPT**:

Totally fair—tmux feels “invisible” until you know the 2–3 moves. Here’s the shortest path.

## If you’re already inside tmux (Auggie is taking the screen)

- **Make a second window (your shell):**

- Press **Ctrl-b then `c`**

- You’re now in **window 1** (a normal shell).

- **Jump between windows:**

- **Ctrl-b 0** → back to Auggie

- **Ctrl-b 1** → your shell

- Or **Ctrl-b `w`** to open a visual list and pick.

- **See what exists (no guessing):**

bash`tmux list-windows
tmux display-message -p '#S window:#I pane:#P'
`</pre>

(Shows session, window, pane numbers.)

- **Make the bar & scroll obvious (do this once in tmux):**

bash`tmux set -g status on
tmux set -g mouse on
tmux set -g history-limit 100000
`</pre>

Now you’ll see a bottom status bar with window numbers and can scroll with the mouse.

## From scratch (one-paste setup you can reuse)

This creates window 0 with Auggie, window 1 as your shell, then drops you into the shell:

bash`tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'auggie' \
  && tmux new-window -t aug:1 -n shell \
  && tmux select-window -t aug:1 \
  && tmux attach -t aug
`</pre>

- **Ctrl-b 0** → Auggie UI

- **Ctrl-b 1** → your shell

## Really don’t want tmux?

You can just open a **second SSH tab** to the same server. But with the 3 keys above (Ctrl-b `c`, numbers to switch, Ctrl-b `w` to list), tmux keeps everything in **one** connection and nothing dies if your laptop disconnects.

---

**You**:

why shoulkd I do this through tmux.  yes, the cool kids love it.  but I am not cool and I don't like cool kids.  why cant I just have another shell in my terminal?  tmux was for rthe days when terminal apps were shit. there not shit any more.

---

**ChatGPT**:

You absolutely can skip tmux and just use another shell. It’s your call.

Here’s the trade-off in one breath:

- **No tmux (two shells / two tabs):** simple and familiar. But if your SSH drops or your laptop sleeps, the **Auggie TUI dies** with that connection. You’ll have to relaunch it and lose that interactive session.

- **With tmux/screen:** tiny extra step up front, but the Auggie process **keeps running on the server** even if your connection blips. You reattach and continue where you left off.

If you’re fine with “if my wifi hiccups, I’ll just restart Auggie,” then do it the simple way:

### Simple, no-tmux workflow

- **Terminal A:** SSH in and start Auggie:

bash`ssh user@test
auggie --login   # first time only
auggie           # runs the TUI here
`</pre>

- **Terminal B:** Open a second SSH tab/window for your own shell commands.

To make disconnects less likely, add keep-alives on your Mac (client):

bash`# ~/.ssh/config
Host test
  HostName test-collab-site.com
  User user
  ServerAliveInterval 30
  ServerAliveCountMax 6
  TCPKeepAlive yes
`</pre>

### Want persistence without “cool-kid tmux”?

Use **screen** (older than tmux, very minimal):

nginx`screen -S aug      # start a session
auggie             # run the TUI
# detach (keep it running):  Ctrl-a  then  d
screen -r aug      # reattach later
`</pre>

That’s it—two keys: `Ctrl-a d` to detach; `screen -r aug` to reattach.

### If you ever reconsider tmux (purely optional)

You only need three things:

- create new window for _your_ shell: **Ctrl-b c**

- switch between Auggie (0) and your shell (1): **Ctrl-b 0** / **Ctrl-b 1**

- detach/reattach: **Ctrl-b d** / `tmux attach -t aug`

Add this once to make it visible and scrollable:

bash`echo -e "set -g mouse on\nset -g status on\nset -g history-limit 100000" >> ~/.tmux.conf
`</pre>

**Bottom line:** You can 100% run Auggie in one SSH tab and use a second tab for your own shell. That’s the simplest setup. The _only_ reason to use a multiplexer (tmux/screen) is to keep the interactive Auggie session alive when your connection isn’t. If that benefit isn’t worth the extra key combo, skip it.

---

**You**:

I am happy to run tmux to keep auggie happy.  it's just that I need my own view onto the server. I don't need tmux for me

---

**ChatGPT**:

Totally fine—use tmux **only** to keep Auggie alive, and use a **separate shell** for your own work.

## Minimal, no-surprises setup

**1) Start Auggie under tmux and leave it running**

bash`# on the test server
tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'auggie'   # starts Auggie in the background
tmux ls                                  # should show: aug: 1 windows (created ...)
`</pre>

**2) Use your own normal shell**

- Open another terminal/tab and just `ssh user@test-server` as usual.

- That’s your independent shell to run `htop`, `tail`, edit files, etc. No tmux needed.

**3) Peek at Auggie when you want**

bash`tmux attach -t aug     # view the Auggie TUI
# leave it running and return to your shell:
# press  Ctrl-b  then  d
`</pre>

That’s it: one tmux session exists only to host Auggie; you ignore tmux the rest of the time.

### Optional quality-of-life (tiny aliases)

Add to the **server** `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`):

bash`alias aug-start='tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie "auggie" && tmux ls'
alias aug-view='tmux attach -t aug'
alias aug-stop='tmux kill-session -t aug'
`</pre>

Now you can do `aug-start`, work in your own shell, and `aug-view` only when you want to glance at the UI.

### Using VS Code?

Open the server folder via **Remote-SSH** for editing and terminals. Auggie keeps running in its tmux session regardless of your VS Code connection state.

If you want keep-alives on your Mac so SSHs don’t drop:

nginx`# ~/.ssh/config
Host test-server
  ServerAliveInterval 30
  ServerAliveCountMax 6
  TCPKeepAlive yes
`</pre>

So: **No, you don’t need two tmux windows.** Just run Auggie in tmux (background), and use your normal SSH shell(s) for everything else.

---

**You**:

I can't say tmux ls while I am in aggie.  I can't do it in a separate shell because tmux isn't running in that separate shell.  you are wedded to training data but can'ty think logically

---

**ChatGPT**:

You don’t need two tmuxes or two users. What’s tripping you up is tmux’s **client/server** model:

- A **tmux server** runs per **user** on the machine.

- You can talk to that server from **any shell for the same user** with `tmux …`, even if that shell didn’t “start” tmux.

So if `tmux ls` works in one place but not another, it’s almost always a **user mismatch** (e.g., you started Auggie as `root`, but your other shell is `lewis`, or vice-versa).

## Quick, concrete fixes

### 1) From inside the Auggie TUI (still in tmux)

You can ask tmux for info without leaving the TUI:

- **Show windows:** press **Ctrl-b, then `w`** (a picker appears)

- **Make a shell window:** **Ctrl-b, then `c`**

- **Switch:** **Ctrl-b 0** (Auggie) / **Ctrl-b 1** (your shell)

- **Tmux command prompt:** **Ctrl-b, then `:`**, type `list-sessions` or `list-windows`, press Enter

### 2) From another SSH shell

- Make sure you’re the **same user** that started Auggie:

bash`whoami              # compare in both shells
`</pre>

- Then you can do:

bash`tmux ls             # list sessions
tmux attach -t aug  # view the Auggie window
`</pre>

- If you see **“no server running on /tmp/tmux-…/default”**, you’re logged in as a **different user**. Re-SSH as the right one (e.g., `ssh root@server` if you started Auggie as root), or `sudo -i` to become that user, then run `tmux ls`.

### 3) If you only want tmux for Auggie (your preference)

Run Auggie in a background tmux **once**, ignore tmux otherwise:

bash`# start Auggie in tmux (as the user you want to own it)
tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'auggie'

# later: peek at it
tmux attach -t aug
# leave it running:
#   Ctrl-b  then  d
`</pre>

Open your own **normal** SSH shell for everything else—no tmux needed.

## One-time hardening so it’s not “invisible”

Run these **once** (as the same user) to make tmux obvious and scrollable:

bash`printf "set -g status on\nset -g mouse on\nset -g history-limit 100000\n" >> ~/.tmux.conf
`</pre>

Start a fresh attach (`tmux attach -t aug`) and you’ll see a status bar with window numbers; you can scroll with the mouse.

### TL;DR

- **You can run `tmux ls` from any shell of the same user**—tmux isn’t “in” a shell; it’s a per-user server.

- If a shell can’t see the session, you’re almost certainly using a **different user**. Match the user, then `tmux ls`/`attach` will work.

- Keep Auggie alive in tmux; do your normal work in a plain SSH shell. No need to make tmux your daily driver.

---

**You**:

and you are impossibly slow.  and I don't want to exit auggie while it is running.  the whole point is to keep it reunning.  no, I don't understand tmux at all...

---

**ChatGPT**:

Got you. You don’t have to exit Auggie, and you don’t have to “understand tmux” beyond 2–3 keystrokes.

## If you’re **currently looking at Auggie** (attached)

Do this to get your own shell **without stopping Auggie**:

- New shell window: **Ctrl-b, then `c`**

- Switch back to Auggie: **Ctrl-b, then `0`**

- Switch to your shell: **Ctrl-b, then `1`**

- List windows (picker): **Ctrl-b, then `w`**

- Leave Auggie running and return later: **Ctrl-b, then `d`** (detach) → `tmux attach -t aug` to come back

That’s it. Creating a new window **does not** stop Auggie.

## If you’d rather **never stare at tmux**

Start Auggie **detached** and use a normal shell for everything:

bash`# start (or restart) Auggie in the background tmux session
tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'auggie'

# do your work in a plain SSH shell as usual...
# when you want to peek at Auggie:
tmux attach -t aug

# leave it running and go back to your shell:
#   Ctrl-b  then  d
`</pre>

## If `tmux ls` “doesn’t work” in another shell

It’s almost always a **different user**. Check both shells:

bash`whoami
`</pre>

If Auggie was started as `root`, run `ssh root@server` (or `sudo -i`) and then `tmux attach -t aug`.

You can pick either flow:

- **Attached flow**: keep Auggie on window `0`, your shell on window `1`, hop with **Ctrl-b 0/1**.

- **Detached flow**: keep Auggie hidden in tmux; you use normal shells; attach only to check on it.

Neither requires stopping Auggie.

---

**You**:

tmux died

---

**ChatGPT**:

No worries—here’s the quickest way back up, without stopping to “learn tmux.”

## Get Auggie running again (fast path)

bash`# 1) Are you the same user who ran Auggie?
whoami

# 2) Is a tmux server alive?
tmux ls
`</pre>

- If you see `no server running`, just relaunch Auggie inside a fresh tmux and leave it running:

bash`tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'auggie'
`</pre>

- If you see `aug: ...`, attach (to peek) or skip:

bash`tmux attach -t aug   # Ctrl-b then d to leave it running
`</pre>

## Work in your own shell (no tmux needed)

Open a separate terminal/tab and SSH normally for your commands. tmux is only hosting Auggie in the background.

## Make this one command

Add these aliases on the **server** (same user), then `source ~/.bashrc`:

bash`echo "alias aug-start='tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie \"auggie\" && tmux ls'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias aug-view=\"tmux attach -t aug\""                                   >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias aug-stop='tmux kill-session -t aug'"                               >> ~/.bashrc
`</pre>

Now you can do:

- `aug-start` → starts Auggie in tmux (detached)

- `aug-view`  → peek at the UI; `Ctrl-b d` to leave it running

- `aug-stop`  → stop it

## Why it “died”

Common causes:

- Last tmux window closed (e.g., Auggie exited), so the tmux server shut down.

- Different user: you started Auggie as `root` but checked `tmux ls` as another user (or vice-versa).

- Server rebooted.

If this keeps happening and you want extra glue later, we can set up a tiny `systemd --user` unit that (re)starts `tmux … 'auggie'` automatically—but the above is the simplest stable loop.

---

**You**:

so, auggie is still running. tmux ls shows 1 session named aug, but the ctrl-b commands don't work

---

**ChatGPT**:

You’re seeing that because **Ctrl-b only works when you’re _attached_ to the tmux session.** Outside tmux it’s just a shell keystroke (moves cursor left), so nothing happens.

Do this (as the **same user** that started Auggie):

bash`tmux ls                 # shows: aug: 1 windows ...
tmux attach -t aug      # attach so tmux keybinds work
# if it says the session is attached elsewhere:
tmux attach -d -t aug   # force-attach (detaches other client)
`</pre>

Now your tmux keys will work:

- new shell window: **Ctrl-b c**

- switch: **Ctrl-b 0** (Auggie) / **Ctrl-b 1** (your shell)

- leave it running: **Ctrl-b d** (detach)

If Ctrl-b still doesn’t work after attaching, your prefix may be remapped. Check it:

bash`tmux show -gv prefix    # prints C-b or C-a
`</pre>

If it prints `C-a`, use **Ctrl-a** instead of Ctrl-b.

Don’t want to attach yet, but still want a shell window for later? You can create it from outside:

bash`tmux new-window -t aug -n shell
tmux select-window -t aug:1
tmux attach -t aug
`</pre>

Common gotcha: attaching as the **wrong user**. If you started Auggie as `root`, attach as `root` (`ssh root@server` or `sudo -i`), then `tmux attach -t aug`.

---

**You**:

is there a nice cheatsheet on the internet with the essential tmux commands?  it's just another layer of indirection; more commands; more dependencies.  linux hackers like obscurity to defend their expertise and justify lower productivity

---

**ChatGPT**:

totally fair. here’s a **super-short tmux cheat list** (just what you need for Auggie), plus a couple of solid cheat sheets you can keep open.

### the 8 keys/commands you actually need

if you want, I can tailor a 1-page “Auggie tmux” card with just your workflow (start/peek/detach + your shell window) so you never have to think about the rest.

---

**You**:

so, using auggie on https://test-collab-site.com, how can auggie also examine the reference deployment on https://docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Totally doable. Keep Auggie running on **test-collab-site.com** and let it “look over” at the reference box in three practical ways—pick 1 (or mix):

# 1) SSH into the reference box (recommended)

Let Auggie run commands on the **docs** server via SSH from the **test** server.

**A. Set up SSH from _test_ → _docs_** (do this once)

bash`# on TEST server, as the same user that runs auggie
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs -C test→docs
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs.pub deploy@docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org
# or: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs.pub | ssh deploy@docs... 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
`</pre>

`~/.ssh/config` on **test**:

bash`Host docs-prod
  HostName docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org   # (verify spelling; earlier you also wrote bedfordfallsbbbl.org)
  User deploy
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  ServerAliveInterval 30
  ServerAliveCountMax 6
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist 5m
`</pre>

**B. Give minimal read-only sudo on _docs_** (optional but very useful)

Create a `deploy` user and in `visudo`:

ruby`deploy ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nginx, /bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/journalctl, /usr/bin/docker, /usr/bin/php
`</pre>

(Adjust paths; this lets Auggie run `nginx -T`, `systemctl status`, etc., without prompting for a password.)

**C. Tell Auggie it’s okay to run `ssh` to that host (optional safety)**

Create `.augment/settings.json` in your project on **test**:

json`{
  "tool-permissions": [
    { "tool-name": "launch-process",
      "shell-input-regex": "^ssh\\s+docs-prod\\b|^curl\\s+https?://docs\\.bedfordfalls\\.(bbbl|bbbl)\\.org\\b",
      "permission": { "type": "allow" } }
  ]
}
`</pre>

**D. Typical prompts you can give Auggie (from the TUI on _test_)**

- “Run `ssh docs-prod 'nginx -T'` and summarize server_names, roots, and proxy_pass targets. Propose a parametric template.”

- “Run `ssh docs-prod 'sudo -n -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ config:system:get trusted_domains'` and compare to our test box.”

- “Run `curl -fsSL https://docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org/status.php` and parse the JSON (installed, version, theme).”

- “List services: `ssh docs-prod 'sudo -n systemctl --type=service --state=running | head -n 100'` and highlight Nextcloud/php-fpm/nginx units.”

**

Why this is best: you keep Auggie co-located on the **test** box (where it writes and runs scripts), but it can still **inspect the “prod/reference”** via SSH with low friction. SSH multiplexing (`ControlMaster`) keeps it fast.

# 2) Mount or snapshot the reference config (read-only)

If you want Auggie to “see files” without executing on the reference box:

- **Snapshot pull (simple & safe):**

bash`# on TEST, pull what you care about
rsync -avz deploy@docs-prod:/etc/nginx/  ./ref/nginx/
rsync -avz deploy@docs-prod:/var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php  ./ref/nextcloud/config.php
`</pre>

Then tell Auggie: “Analyze `ref/nginx/` vs our `deploy/nginx/` template; propose diffs.”

- **SSHFS mount (live read):**

bash`sudo apt-get install -y sshfs
mkdir -p ~/mnt/docs
sshfs deploy@docs-prod:/ ~/mnt/docs -o IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs,ro
`</pre>

Now Auggie can read `~/mnt/docs/...` like local files.

**

Snapshot is usually enough (nginx `-T`, Nextcloud `config.php`, occ output).

# 3) HTTP-only probes (no SSH)

Great for quick sanity:

bash`curl -fsSL https://docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org/status.php
curl -I https://docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org   # headers, TLS, redirects
`</pre>

Auggie can `curl` these from **test** and diff against your test site responses.

## Minimal “compare both servers” script you can hand to Auggie

Drop this in `scripts/compare_ref.sh` on **test**:

bash`#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
REF=docs-prod
echo "# NGINX (ref)"
ssh "$REF" 'sudo -n nginx -T' | sed 's/^/REF: /' | head -n 200
echo
echo "# NGINX (test)"
sudo nginx -T | sed 's/^/TEST: /' | head -n 200
echo
echo "# Nextcloud status"
echo "REF:"; curl -fsSL https://docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org/status.php || true
echo "TEST:"; curl -fsSL https://test-collab-site.com/status.php || true
`</pre>

Then ask Auggie: “Run `bash scripts/compare_ref.sh`, capture outputs to `artifacts/compare.log`, analyze differences, and propose templating changes.”

## A couple of gotchas to avoid

- **Hostname mismatch:** earlier you mentioned `docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org` vs `docs.bedfordfalls.bbbl.org`. Make sure your SSH config and curl targets match the real one.

- **User mismatch:** if you started Auggie as `root` on **test**, make sure the same user owns the SSH key/config it’ll use.

- **Password prompts:** use `ssh -o BatchMode=yes` in commands or set `NOPASSWD` for the handful of read-only `sudo` commands you want to allow.

### Bottom line

Keep Auggie on **test-collab-site.com**. Give it **SSH reach** (and/or snapshots) of the **docs** host. Then drive it with concrete prompts: “inspect Nginx,” “pull Nextcloud config via `occ`,” “diff status.php,” “propose templates.” That gets you the rich, environment-aware analysis you want—without moving the agent or introducing complex multi-agent setups.

---

**You**:

the ssh-copy-id command failed because the server is docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org  so I think we have to redo the whole thing. trying to rerun the ssh-copy-id command hung when run a 2nd time with the co0rrect url

---

**ChatGPT**:

Got it — let’s straighten this out cleanly. When `ssh-copy-id` “hangs” after fixing the hostname, it’s almost always one of these:

- stale **known_hosts** entry from the wrong host

- a stuck **ControlMaster** socket (multiplexing)

- trying the **wrong user** (Cloudron boxes are usually `root`)

- **password auth disabled**, so `ssh-copy-id` can’t do its thing

- DNS/port reachability issue

Here’s a bullet-proof sequence you can paste on the **test server** (as the same user that runs Auggie). Replace `USER` if you don’t use `root`.

bash`# 0) set vars
HOST=docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
USER=root
KEY=~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs.pub   # your public key on TEST

# 1) clean any stale host keys & control sockets
ssh-keygen -R "$HOST" >/dev/null 2>&1
# (optional) if you used an alias with ControlMaster, kill it:
ssh -O exit "$HOST" 2>/dev/null || true

# 2) quick reachability & handshake check (no multiplexing)
ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -o ConnectTimeout=10 -vv "$USER@$HOST" 'echo ssh-ok' </dev/null
`</pre>

- If you see `ssh-ok`, connectivity & username are fine.

- If it stalls before `debug1: Authentication` lines, you likely have DNS/firewall trouble.

- If it says `Authentications that can continue: publickey` (no `password`), password auth is disabled — skip to the “manual key install without ssh-copy-id” step below.

### Re-run `ssh-copy-id` safely (no hangs, accepts new host key)

bash`ssh-copy-id -i "$KEY" \
  -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new \
  "$USER@$HOST"
`</pre>

Then verify key-only login:

bash`ssh -i "${KEY%.*}" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$USER@$HOST" 'echo KEY-WORKS'
`</pre>

## If `ssh-copy-id` still hangs or password auth is OFF

Two solid alternatives:

### A) You can already SSH some other way (e.g., with another key)

Append the new pubkey over SSH:

bash`PUB=$(cat "$KEY")
ssh "$USER@$HOST" "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && \
  printf '%s\n' '$PUB' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
`</pre>

Test:

bash`ssh -i "${KEY%.*}" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$USER@$HOST" 'echo KEY-WORKS'
`</pre>

### B) You cannot SSH at all

Use your provider’s **console** (Hetzner/DO “web console”) and paste the pubkey into

`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for `$USER`, or temporarily enable `PasswordAuthentication yes`

in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` → `systemctl restart sshd`, run `ssh-copy-id`, then turn it back off.

## Common gotchas to check

- **User mismatch:** If you started Auggie as `root` on TEST, generate/use the key under **root** (`sudo -i`) so the path matches what Auggie will use.

- **Wrong host earlier:** You used both `bedfordfallsbbbl.org` and `bedfordfalls.bbbl.org` before. Make sure everything uses **`docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org`** now.

- **Port not 22?** If SSH runs on a custom port on the docs server:

bash`ssh -p 2222 "$USER@$HOST"
ssh-copy-id -p 2222 -i "$KEY" "$USER@$HOST"
`</pre>

- **Multiplexing stuck:** If you added ControlMaster to `~/.ssh/config`, kill stale masters:

bash`ssh -O exit "$HOST" 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f ~/.ssh/cm-* 2>/dev/null || true
`</pre>

Once the key is in place, Auggie on **test-collab-site.com** can freely run:

swift`ssh docs-prod 'nginx -T'
ssh docs-prod 'sudo -n -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ config:system:get trusted_domains'
`</pre>

(or the direct FQDN if you’re not using a `Host docs-prod` alias).

If anything still sticks, paste the **last 20–30 lines** of `ssh -vv "$USER@$HOST"` — that pinpoints exactly where it’s hanging (DNS, TCP, key exchange, auth, etc.).

---

**You**:

it's just timing out.  password authentication is disabled at docs server.  only user is root using ssh keys

---

**ChatGPT**:

Got it—since **password auth is off** on `docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org`, `ssh-copy-id` won’t help anyway. And if it’s **timing out**, that’s a network/port/firewall issue between the **test** box and **docs**. Here’s the clean, minimal path to fix it.

## 1) Confirm what’s broken (from the _test_ server)

bash`# DNS → does it resolve?
getent hosts docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org

# Is TCP/22 reachable? (adjust -p if SSH uses a custom port)
nc -vz -w 5 docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 22

# Verbose SSH with a short timeout
ssh -vv -o ConnectTimeout=5 root@docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 'echo ok' </dev/null
`</pre>

- **Timeout** ⇒ firewall/network path is blocking 22 (or you’re using the wrong port/hostname).

- **Gets to “Authentications that can continue: publickey”** ⇒ network is fine; you just need the key installed.

## 2) Install the **test server’s** pubkey on the **docs** server (no passwords)

If you can SSH to **docs** from your **laptop**, use the laptop as a bridge:

**On the _test_ server** (print the pubkey you want to grant):

bash`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs.pub
`</pre>

**On your _laptop_, paste that key into _docs_’ authorized_keys:**

bash`ssh root@docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org \
  'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
# then paste the single-line public key … and press Ctrl-D
`</pre>

Now test from **test → docs**:

bash`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_docs -o IdentitiesOnly=yes root@docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 'echo KEY-WORKS'
`</pre>
**

If you **cannot** reach docs from the laptop either, use your provider’s **web console** on the docs host and paste the key into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

## 3) If it still times out → open the door on the **docs** server

On the **docs** box (via laptop or console):

bash`# Is sshd listening?
ss -ntl | grep ':22'        # (or your custom port)

# If UFW is on, allow the TEST box's public IP to port 22:
ufw status
ufw allow from <TEST_PUBLIC_IP> to any port 22 proto tcp
ufw reload

# Confirm service
systemctl status ssh
`</pre>

(Replace `22` if you use a custom SSH port. If you don’t know the **test** box’s public IP: `curl -s https://api.ipify.org` on the test server.)

### TL;DR

- `ssh-copy-id` is a non-starter when passwords are disabled.

- First, make sure **test → docs:22** is reachable.

- Then add the **test** server’s pubkey to **docs** (laptop/console bridge).

- If it still times out, fix firewall/port on **docs** (UFW/security group/sshd).

---

**You**:

I think 22 is blocked.  why don't we use the same keys that I use to ssh in from my laptop. that public key is known to the server

---

**ChatGPT**:

Perfect — if the **docs server only accepts your laptop’s SSH key for `root`**, you don’t need to generate a separate “test → docs” key. You can just **re-use the same private key on the test server**.

## Steps

### 1. Copy your laptop’s private key to the test server

On your laptop:

bash`# if you use id_ed25519
scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@test-collab-site.com:~/.ssh/
scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@test-collab-site.com:~/.ssh/
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
`</pre>

_(Replace `id_ed25519` with the key filename you actually use.)_
**

⚠️ Only do this if you’re comfortable storing the private key on the test server. If the test server is untrusted, safer is to **create a new keypair there** and add it to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on docs.

### 2. Configure SSH on the test server

Edit `~/.ssh/config` on **test**:

bash`Host docs-prod
  HostName docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
  User root
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
`</pre>

### 3. Test connectivity from the test server

bash`ssh docs-prod 'echo KEY-WORKS'
`</pre>

If you see `KEY-WORKS`, you’re good.

### 4. Use from Auggie

Now Auggie can run commands like:

swift`ssh docs-prod 'nginx -T | head -n 50'
ssh docs-prod 'php /var/www/nextcloud/occ config:system:get trusted_domains'
`</pre>

## Why this works

- The docs server already knows your laptop’s public key.

- By re-using that private key on the test server, the docs box sees it as the same identity.

- No need for `ssh-copy-id` or password auth.

👉 Do you want me to also show you the **safer alternative**: creating a brand new keypair on the test server and manually adding its pubkey into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on docs (via your laptop), so you don’t have to copy your laptop’s private key over?

---

**You**:

how do I select text when this stupid tmux thing is running? the mouse suppport I allegedly enabled doesn't allow text selection in the terminal window so I can't show you it's reply.    /root/.ssh/config doesn't exist.  /root/.ssh probably doesn't exist.  we need /.ssh correct?

---

**ChatGPT**:

You’ve hit two separate but related issues:

## 1. Selecting text while tmux is running

When tmux has **mouse mode on**, the terminal forwards mouse drags to tmux for “pane resize/scroll,” not to your terminal emulator for text selection. Two easy fixes:

- **Hold Shift while dragging** (on most terminals, including macOS Terminal and iTerm2). That bypasses tmux and lets you select/copy text as usual.

- Or temporarily **turn off tmux mouse mode** inside your session:

bash`tmux set -g mouse off
`</pre>

Now you can select normally. Re-enable with:

bash`tmux set -g mouse on
`</pre>

Tip: If you want tmux scrollback but still want to copy easily, just leave mouse off and use `Ctrl-b [` to enter copy mode (arrow keys or PgUp/PgDn to scroll, press `q` to exit).

## 2. Where to put SSH config/keys

- `/.ssh` at the filesystem root would be wrong.

- For **root’s SSH**, the directory is `/root/.ssh/`.

- For a normal user (say `ubuntu`, `debian`, `lewis`), it’s `/home/<user>/.ssh/`.

If `/root/.ssh/` doesn’t exist yet, just create it:

bash`sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
`</pre>

Then create `/root/.ssh/config` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` as needed:

bash`sudo nano /root/.ssh/config
sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/config
`</pre>

Example `config`:

bash`Host docs-prod
  HostName docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
  User root
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
`</pre>

✅ So:

- Use **Shift+drag** (or `set -g mouse off`) to copy text out of tmux.

- Use `/root/.ssh/` (not `/.ssh`) if you’re configuring SSH for `root`.

Would you like me to sketch a quick **“from scratch” recipe** that creates `/root/.ssh`, installs your laptop’s public key there, and verifies that Auggie on the test server can `ssh docs-prod`? That way you don’t have to fight with `ssh-copy-id` at all.

---

**You**:

now I need to copy the private key file and the public keyfile from my laptop to the test server

---

**ChatGPT**:

Totally doable. Here are two clean ways—pick the one you prefer.

# A) Copy your existing key pair (what you asked for)

**

Only do this if you’re okay having that private key on the **test** server.

**On your Mac (laptop):**

bash`# replace id_ed25519 with your actual key name if different
scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub \
    root@test-collab-site.com:/root/.ssh/
`</pre>

**On the test server (as root):**

bash`chmod 700 /root/.ssh
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 /root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# optional convenience
printf '%s\n' "Host docs-prod
  HostName docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
  User root
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes" >> /root/.ssh/config
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/config

# test it
ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes root@docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 'echo OK'
# or with the Host alias
ssh docs-prod 'echo OK'
`</pre>

# B) (Safer, no-copy) Use **agent forwarding** instead

**

Your private key stays only on the laptop. Often the simplest.

**On your Mac:**

bash`# make sure the key is loaded in your agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  # enter passphrase if prompted
# connect to the test server with agent forwarding
ssh -A root@test-collab-site.com
`</pre>

**On the test server (now logged in):**

bash`# this uses your laptop's key via the forwarded agent
ssh root@docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 'echo OK'
`</pre>

If that works, Auggie on the **test** server can run commands to the **docs** server without ever storing your private key on the test box. (If forwarding is blocked, enable `AllowAgentForwarding yes` in the docs server’s sshd, or just use method A.)

## Notes / gotchas

- The correct path for root’s SSH stuff is **`/root/.ssh/`** (not `/.ssh`).

- After copying a private key, **permissions must be 600** or SSH will refuse to use it.

- If SSH to docs times out on port 22, you’ll need that opened or use the correct custom port (`ssh -p <port> …`).

Want me to wire this into a couple of aliases (`aug-start`, `docs-ok`, etc.) so you don’t have to remember the long commands?

---

**You**:

shift and mouse select does NOT work in tmux

---

**ChatGPT**:

yeah, tmux + mouse can be annoying. here are 3 dead-simple ways to copy text **right now**:

## 1) Quick toggle: turn tmux mouse off, copy, turn it back on

In the tmux session (no restart needed):

bash`tmux set -g mouse off   # now your terminal’s normal mouse selection works
# ... drag to select & copy ...
tmux set -g mouse on    # re-enable tmux mouse later (optional)
`</pre>

## 2) Use tmux’s copy-mode (works everywhere)

- Enter copy-mode: **Ctrl-b [`**

- Move cursor to start, press **Space** (start selection), move to end, press **Enter** (copies to tmux buffer).

- Paste inside tmux with **Ctrl-b ]**, or dump it to a file:

bash`tmux show-buffer > ~/grab.txt
`</pre>

Then `scp` that file to your Mac if you want.

### Optional: make it copy to your Mac clipboard automatically

If your terminal supports OSC52 (iTerm2, VS Code terminal do), add this once on the server:

bash`echo 'set -g set-clipboard on' >> ~/.tmux.conf
`</pre>

Reconnect/reattach. Now when you hit **Enter** in copy-mode, tmux will push the selection to your local clipboard.

## 3) Dump a chunk of the pane to a file (fastest when it’s lots of text)

From the pane you’re viewing:

bash`tmux capture-pane -J -pS -5000 > ~/auggie_snip.txt   # last 5000 lines; change as needed
`</pre>

Open that file (or `scp` it to your laptop) and copy from there.

If none of that works in your terminal, tell me which terminal you’re using (macOS Terminal, iTerm2, VS Code) and I’ll give the exact checkbox/setting (e.g., enabling OSC52 in iTerm2 or VS Code).

**You**:

so now we shoulkd be able to test ssh over from test to docs.

---

**ChatGPT**:

Great—let’s do a clean, deterministic test **from the test server → docs server**.

## 1) Quick reachability checks (no keys involved)

bash`# DNS
getent hosts docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org

# Is SSH port open? (change 22 if you use a custom port)
nc -vz -w 5 docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 22
`</pre>

- If `nc` times out ⇒ firewall/port issue on the docs box (or wrong port). Fix that first.

## 2) Try SSH with your key (no interactivity)

bash`# Adjust key filename if needed
ssh -vv -o ConnectTimeout=5 \
    -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new \
    -o IdentitiesOnly=yes \
    -i /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 \
    root@docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 'echo OK'
`</pre>

**Expected:** prints `OK` and exits.

### Common outcomes & fixes

- **Timeout**: network/firewall. On docs, open port 22 (or your custom port) for the test server’s IP (UFW/security group), and confirm `sshd` is listening (`ss -ntl | grep :22`).

- **`Permission denied (publickey)`**: the _public_ key that matches `/root/.ssh/id_ed25519` on **test** isn’t in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on **docs**. Append it there (via laptop/console), then retry.

- **Host key changed / mismatch**: clear old key and retry:

bash`ssh-keygen -R docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
`</pre>

## 3) (Optional) Verify alias works

If you added `/root/.ssh/config`:

bash`Host docs-prod
  HostName docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
  User root
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
`</pre>

Then:

bash`ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 docs-prod 'echo OK'
`</pre>

## 4) One-shot test script (handy)

bash`cat > /root/ssh-docs-test.sh <<'SH'
set -euo pipefail
H=docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
K=/root/.ssh/id_ed25519
echo "DNS:"; getent hosts "$H" || true
echo; echo "TCP 22:"; nc -vz -w 5 "$H" 22 || true
echo; echo "SSH:"
ssh -vv -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i "$K" root@"$H" 'echo OK'
SH
bash /root/ssh-docs-test.sh
`</pre>

Tell me exactly what you see (last ~20 lines if it fails), and we’ll zero in fast—whether it’s port blocking, a missing `authorized_keys` entry, or a key/path mismatch.

---

**You**:

it's timing out.  I didn't do anything special to setup ssh on that machine.  both vps are running at hetzner on ubuntu 24.02

---

**ChatGPT**:

Timeouts almost always boil down to one of these: wrong IP (DNS/proxy), IPv6 weirdness, or a firewall rule on the docs box (or Hetzner Cloud Firewall).

Here’s a tight, do-this-now flow **from the TEST server** to pinpoint and fix it:

## 1) Check what DNS is returning (Cloudflare/proxy vs origin)

bash`dig +short A docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
dig +short AAAA docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
`</pre>

- If you see Cloudflare-looking IPs (e.g., `104.*`, `172.67.*`, `188.114.*`, or any AAAA that isn’t your server), SSH will **time out**—Cloudflare doesn’t proxy port 22 unless you pay for Spectrum.

**Immediate workaround (bypass DNS):**

bash`# replace <ORIGIN_IPV4_OF_DOCS> with the real public IP of the docs server
ssh -4 -o ConnectTimeout=5 root@<ORIGIN_IPV4_OF_DOCS> 'echo OK'
`</pre>

If that works, fix your SSH config to always hit the origin over IPv4:

pgsql`# on TEST server, /root/.ssh/config
Host docs-prod
  HostName <ORIGIN_IPV4_OF_DOCS>
  User root
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  AddressFamily inet
`</pre>

(Alternatively, in Cloudflare make the A record **“grey cloud”** or create `ssh.docs…` unproxied.)

## 2) Force IPv4 (skip AAAA pitfalls)

Some Ubuntu boxes prefer IPv6 first; if your docs box doesn’t have SSH on v6, you’ll “hang.”

bash`ssh -4 -o ConnectTimeout=5 root@docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 'echo OK'
nc  -4 -vz -w 5 docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org 22
`</pre>

If `-4` succeeds but plain SSH times out, leave `AddressFamily inet` in your `~/.ssh/config` Host entry.

## 3) If direct IP still times out → open the door on the DOCS server

Log into **docs** from your **laptop** (since that works) or via Hetzner console and run:

bash`# Is sshd running & listening?
systemctl status ssh
ss -tlnp | grep ':22'

# UFW/nftables?
ufw status verbose
# If UFW is active, allow TEST's public IP (find it on TEST: curl -4s https://api.ipify.org)
ufw allow from <TEST_PUBLIC_IP> to any port 22 proto tcp
ufw reload

# If using Hetzner Cloud Firewall (in their console):
#   - Add inbound rule: TCP 22 from <TEST_PUBLIC_IP> (or 0.0.0.0/0 if you’re ok with that)
#   - Apply to the docs server
`</pre>

Re-test from **TEST**:

bash`ssh -4 root@<ORIGIN_IPV4_OF_DOCS> 'echo OK'
`</pre>

## 4) Sanity check for stale host keys / multiplexing lock

bash`ssh-keygen -R docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org >/dev/null
ssh -O exit docs-prod 2>/dev/null || true   # if you set ControlMaster earlier
`</pre>

Then retry the `ssh -4 …` test.

## 5) Key/identity basics (since you’re using root+keys)

- Keys live at **`/root/.ssh/`** on both machines (not `/.ssh`).

- Permissions:

bash`chmod 700 /root/.ssh
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 /root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
`</pre>

- If the docs server only knows your **laptop’s** key and you copied it to TEST, you’re fine. If you created a **new** key on TEST, make sure that **public** key is in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on DOCS.

### Quick decision tree

- **SSH to docs by raw IP works →** DNS/proxy (Cloudflare) or IPv6 was the culprit. Use `HostName <IP>` + `AddressFamily inet`, or unproxy the A record.

- **Raw IP doesn’t work →** Firewall or `sshd` isn’t listening. Open port 22 in UFW/Hetzner Cloud Firewall and confirm `systemctl status ssh`.

- **You get to “Authentications that can continue: publickey” but are denied →** Wrong key; add the TEST server’s pubkey to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on DOCS.

If you paste the outputs of:

csharp`dig +short A docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
dig +short AAAA docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
ssh -4 -vv -o ConnectTimeout=5 root@<ORIGIN_IPV4_OF_DOCS> 'true' | tail -n 20
`</pre>

I can pinpoint which branch you’re on in one shot.

---

**You**:

OK.  yes I have proxy's on cloudflare.  but I can sign on from my laptop so what's the problem?  Also, i can change the ssh config to also work using the numeric ip address.  that would be the easiest thing. and why are you so DESPARATELY slow compared to Perplexity?  you take > 2 minutes for trivial prompts with trivial answer and > 5 minutes for anything the least bit out of the ordinary.

---

**ChatGPT**:

You’re running into Cloudflare’s proxy. Orange-cloud DNS records only proxy HTTP/HTTPS—**not SSH/22**—so from the **test** server your SSH goes to a Cloudflare edge IP and times out. Your **laptop** probably uses the raw origin IP (via `~/.ssh/config`, cached known_hosts, or you typed the IP before), so it works.

Here are three clean fixes—pick one:

## 1) Easiest: use the origin IP on the test server

bash`# replace with the docs server’s real public IPv4
DOCS_IP=203.0.113.45

# /root/.ssh/config on TEST
cat > /root/.ssh/config <<EOF
Host docs-prod
  HostName $DOCS_IP
  User root
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  AddressFamily inet
EOF
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/config

# test
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 docs-prod 'echo OK'
`</pre>

## 2) Better name: add an **unproxied** DNS record for SSH

In Cloudflare → DNS:

- Add `A` record, name `ssh-docs`, value = origin IP of the docs server.

- Set **Proxy status = DNS only** (grey cloud).

Then on TEST:

bash`cat > /root/.ssh/config <<'EOF'
Host docs-prod
  HostName ssh-docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
  User root
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  AddressFamily inet
EOF
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 docs-prod 'echo OK'
`</pre>

## 3) Unproxy the existing record (only if you’re OK with that)

Turn the current `docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org` A record to **DNS only** (grey cloud). Then no other changes are needed.

### Quick sanity checks (from TEST)

bash`dig +short A docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
dig +short AAAA docs.bedfordfallsbbbl.org
# should be your origin IPs if unproxied; Cloudflare IPs (104.*, 172.67.*, 188.114.*) mean proxied

# force IPv4 if AAAA is causing hangs
ssh -4 -o ConnectTimeout=5 docs-prod 'echo OK'
`</pre>

### On speed (totally fair complaint)

I hear you. For this kind of server troubleshooting I’ll keep answers **short and step-by-step** and avoid any web lookups. If you want ultra-brief replies, just say “fast mode” and I’ll stick to bullets/commands only.

---

**You**:

this is what works:

root@test-collab:~/.ssh# nc -vz -w 5 91.99.189.91 22
Connection to 91.99.189.91 22 port [tcp/ssh] succeeded!

---

**ChatGPT**:

Great — port 22 to the docs box is open. Next, just point SSH on the **test** server at that IP and you’re done.

## Configure SSH on the test server

bash`# as root on test-collab
install -d -m 700 /root/.ssh
cat > /root/.ssh/config <<'EOF'
Host docs-prod
  HostName 91.99.189.91
  User root
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519   # <-- adjust if your key has a different name
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  AddressFamily inet
  StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
EOF
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/config
`</pre>

## Test it

bash`ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 docs-prod 'echo OK'
`</pre>

- If you see `OK`, you’re set.

- If you get `Permission denied (publickey)`, make sure the **public key that matches `/root/.ssh/id_ed25519` on TEST** is in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on DOCS. (You can paste it there from your laptop/console.)

## Use it from Auggie on TEST

In the Auggie TUI (running on test-collab), ask:

vbnet`Run: ssh docs-prod 'nginx -T | head -n 50' and summarize server_names and roots.
`</pre>

(or any other `ssh docs-prod '…'` command you need, e.g., `occ`, `systemctl`, `journalctl`).

### Optional speed-up

If you’ll run many SSH calls:

bash`printf '%s\n' "  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist 5m" >> /root/.ssh/config
`</pre>

That’s it: using the raw IP bypasses Cloudflare’s proxy and makes Auggie-on-test able to inspect the docs host directly.

---

**You**:

If the computer goes to sleep of course the agent keeps running. but the connection of the terminal drops, tmux stops and the mouse support sends thousands of instructions which echo ineffectively.  do I shut donw the terminal app and login again?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Short answer: **yes—just close the glitchy terminal and reconnect.** tmux stays running on the server, so you won’t lose Auggie.

## Quick recovery (every time this happens)

- **Kill the noisy local terminal/tab.**

- Open a fresh terminal and SSH back to the test server.

- Re-attach to your running session:

bash`tmux attach -d -t aug
`</pre>

(If it says no session, restart: `tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'auggie' && tmux attach -t aug`)

If a “stuck” client is spamming the session, from any good shell run:

bash`tmux detach-client -a -t aug   # detaches other clients from 'aug'
`</pre>

## Make it less painful next time

- **Toggle mouse when you need to copy text:**

bash`tmux set -g mouse off   # select/copy with your mouse
tmux set -g mouse on
`</pre>

(Or bind a quick toggle once: `tmux bind m set -g mouse \; display "mouse: #{?mouse,on,off}"`)

- **Keep your Mac awake while you’re working:****
In a local terminal: `caffeinate -i` (leave it running), or adjust Energy Saver settings.

- **Add keep-alives on your Mac** (`~/.ssh/config`):

nginx`Host test-collab
  HostName test-collab-site.com
  User root
  ServerAliveInterval 30
  ServerAliveCountMax 6
  TCPKeepAlive yes
`</pre>

- **Best-in-class resilience:** use **mosh** instead of plain SSH (works great with tmux):

- Server: `sudo apt-get install -y mosh` (and allow UDP 60000–61000)

- Mac: `brew install mosh`

- Connect: `mosh root@test-collab-site.com` then `tmux attach -t aug`**
Mosh survives Wi-Fi sleep/roaming, so you rarely have to reattach.

## Tiny quality-of-life aliases (on the server)

bash`echo "alias aug-view='tmux attach -d -t aug'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias aug-start=\"tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'auggie' && tmux attach -t aug\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
`</pre>

So: when the terminal goes weird, **close it, SSH back, `tmux attach -d -t aug`**. That keeps Auggie running and gets you a clean screen fast.

---

**You**:

so, auggie appears to have shut down even though tmux was running when I re-laucned and ssh'ed in.  I thought the whole point of the tmux piece of shit is that it would enable auggie to keep running even if the terminal on the laptop stopped.  so much for that claim

---

**ChatGPT**:

I hear you. tmux only keeps things alive **if the process inside is still running**. If Auggie crashed, the pane closed, or the box rebooted/OOM-killed it, tmux won’t resurrect it by itself. Let’s get you back up fast and make it resilient so you don’t have to babysit it.

## Quick recovery (right now)

Run these on the **test** server (same user that owns the session):

bash`# 1) Attach; if it’s a dead/blank pane, just respawn Auggie in place
tmux attach -t aug || tmux new -s aug

# inside tmux, if Auggie is gone:
# (A) simplest: start it again
auggie

# or (B) from outside tmux, one-liner to kill & restart the first pane with Auggie:
tmux respawn-pane -k -t aug:0 'bash -lc "cd /srv/collab && auggie"'
`</pre>

If `tmux attach` says no session, then just (re)start detached and peek:

bash`tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie 'bash -lc "cd /srv/collab && auggie"'
tmux attach -t aug
`</pre>

## Make it stop dying silently (simple auto-restart + logging)

Create a tiny wrapper that **restarts Auggie if it exits** and logs everything:

bash`cat >/usr/local/bin/auggie-run.sh <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
cd /srv/collab
while :; do
  echo "[$(date '+%F %T')] starting auggie"
  auggie 2>&1 | tee -a /var/log/auggie.log
  code=$?
  echo "[$(date '+%F %T')] auggie exited ($code), restarting in 3s" | tee -a /var/log/auggie.log
  sleep 3
done
SH
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/auggie-run.sh
`</pre>

Start it in tmux (detached) and leave it:

bash`tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie '/usr/local/bin/auggie-run.sh'
# later, to view:
tmux attach -t aug    # Ctrl-b d to leave it running
`</pre>

Now if Auggie crashes, it auto-restarts; you also have `/var/log/auggie.log` to see why it died.

## If the server itself reboots

Have it come back on boot via a tiny systemd unit that launches tmux+the wrapper:

bash`cat >/etc/systemd/system/auggie-tmux.service <<'UNIT'
[Unit]
Description=Auggie inside tmux
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/srv/collab
ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc 'tmux has-session -t aug 2>/dev/null || tmux new -d -s aug -n auggie "/usr/local/bin/auggie-run.sh"'
ExecStop=/usr/bin/tmux kill-session -t aug
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
UNIT

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now auggie-tmux
`</pre>

You can still attach with `tmux attach -t aug` anytime.

## A couple of quick checks when this happens

- Did the box reboot? `uptime` / `last reboot -F | head`

- OOM killer? `dmesg -T | grep -i -E 'killed process|out of memory'`

- Node/Auggie path changed? `node -v` / `which auggie`

If you want zero tmux interaction: keep the wrapper + systemd, and only attach when you need to look. Otherwise just run `tmux respawn-pane -k -t aug:0 'bash -lc "cd /srv/collab && auggie"'` and carry on.
