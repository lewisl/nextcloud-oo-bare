**You**:

I cannot add an Amex card, a Visa card or Apple pay to my account with Augment Code to buy more messages.  I am always told that my card has been denied. there is no problem whatsoever with Amex, my bank or my Apple Pay accounts.  Augment Code uses Stripe plus "Orb" as their payment processor.  I am using Librewolf to reach the Augment Code website.  What is wrong?  Is this a sufficiently capable company to handle such mundane things as payment processing?  they are also extremely unresponsive to support requests.  Are they in financial trouble and laying off "non-essential" people?

**ChatGPT**:

I don’t have proof that Augment Code is insolvent or shutting down; they seem to be moderately well-funded (raised ~$250M) and still hiring. [LinkedIn+3Augment Code+3TrueUp+3](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/augment-inc-raises-227-million?utm_source=chatgpt.com) But your payment issue sounds frustrating; there are a few plausible causes and things you can try. I’ll walk through what might be going wrong, what this suggests about Augment’s capabilities, and what you can do to try to resolve it. If you want, I can help you test/work around the issue.

## What might be causing the payment failures

Even though your bank/Amex/Apple Pay are working elsewhere, there are many points of failure in a payment chain, especially when third-party processors and cross-border or fraud-prevention rules are involved. Some possibilities:

- **Decline by issuer due to “type of purchase” or merchant category****
Sometimes the bank or card’s fraud algorithms block certain kinds of merchants or industries. The error message “card denied” or “does not support this type of purchase” might mean your card provider thinks this charge is risky, or the merchant (Augment/Stripe/Orb) is registered under a category your card is restricted from. Stripe’s docs mention cards being declined because of cross-border restrictions, or because the card is a type (debit, corporate, etc.) that doesn't allow certain categories. [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/your-card-does-not-support-this-type-of-purchase-error-when-processing-payment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Payment processor configuration issues****
Because Augment uses **Orb** together with **Stripe** for billing/invoicing/subscriptions, there may be misconfigurations in how the payment flow is set up. For instance:

- The billing address or the country in your profile might not match what the card issuer expects.

- The processor might be triggering extra verification or fraud checks (e.g. AVS mismatch, 3D Secure failure) that fail silently or result in generic “denied” messages.

- Some payment methods (in Apple Pay, Amex) require specific support or the merchant must explicitly enable them.

- **Browser or client issues****
You mentioned using **Librewolf**. Some privacy-focused browsers disable certain features (cookies, trackers, JavaScript, cross-site requests, etc.) that payment flows require. If Orb/Stripe require certain scripts or handshakes, or for 3D Secure popups, those might be blocked. That can lead to a denial without clear error.

- **Geographic / currency / regulatory issues****
If you are in a different country from what Augment expects or what your card is issued in, that can trigger restrictions. Some cards are not allowed for “subscription” purchases or international transactions.

- **Technical bugs or temporary failures on their side****
Could be a bug in Augment’s integration with Orb/Stripe; maybe they recently changed something. Could be server side issues, or mis-routing payments.

## What this suggests about Augment Code’s capabilities and situation

- They are using “modern” but nontrivial payment infrastructure: Stripe + Orb. That is a decent sign that they are trying to build a flexible, usage-based billing system. Orb specifically is designed for complex billing (usage-based, hybrid, etc.). [Orb+1](https://www.withorb.com/blog/stripe-limitations-for-usage-based-billing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- The fact you see many people discussing similar issues (on Reddit, etc.) suggests this isn’t just you. It points to either systemic configuration issues (for certain types of cards or regions) or incomplete onboarding of payment flows. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1l26jaa/trouble_subscribing_to_augment_code_ai_from_india/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Being unresponsive in support is not unusual for fast-growing startups, but it’s concerning. It doesn’t necessarily signal financial trouble; often it’s just staffing or prioritization. But it _does_ mean you may have to do more yourself to diagnose.

- The funding & size suggests they are not likely to be failing imminently (at least not publicly). They recently raised large rounds, their valuation is nearly a billion, etc. [Augment Code+2PitchBook+2](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/augment-inc-raises-227-million?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## What you can try / steps to resolve

Here are concrete steps you can try to get it working or possibly pinpoint the problem:

- **Try a different browser / disable privacy features****
Use a mainstream browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with a clean profile. Make sure JavaScript is enabled, cookies allowed, no ad-blocker or script blocker interfering. Especially things like cross-site scripting or cross-site resource blocking might break parts of the payment flow or 3D Secure challenge.

- **Use a different card / payment method****
If possible, try another Amex, or another Visa, or even a Mastercard if you have one. Or try adding a card from a different bank. Try Apple Pay vs direct card. See if one of them works. That helps identify whether it’s a card-issuer issue.

- **Check with your bank / card issuer****
Ask them if they see any transactions attempted (maybe they rejected them). Ask if your card is allowed to do transactions with “subscription” merchants or foreign merchants. See if there are fraud/security settings you can loosen temporarily (e.g., cross-border allowed, eCommerce allowed, etc.)

- **Contact Augment Code support with details****
When you contact them, give them as much detail as possible: what browser you are using (Librewolf), OS, card type, whether Apple Pay or direct card, country of card / billing address, exact error message or code if any. If possible, screenshot or copy the exact text.

- **Try incognito / clearing cache****
Sometimes cookies, cached sessions, or stale data interfere. Fresh session may help.

- **Try alternate payment (if available)****
See if they have PayPal, or “one-time payment link”, or bank transfer, etc. (Sometimes companies offer alternatives if card fail.)

If you like, I can try to see if there are others reporting the same problem _from your country_, see if there’s a workaround, or check whether Augment Code has posted known payment-issues. Do you want me to dig for that?

---

**You**:

Amex reports that no payment request has ever been made so they are not denying.  SAme with USAA. this is clearly a problem on Augment Code's end.

---

**ChatGPT**:

That’s a very helpful datapoint: if **Amex and USAA never even see the authorization request**, then the problem is upstream of them — entirely in **Augment Code’s payment flow** (Stripe/Orb integration, or their frontend).

That narrows it to:

## Where the failure is happening

- **Client-side / browser flow never completes**

- Librewolf may be blocking Stripe’s 3-D Secure iFrame, cross-origin scripts, or Orb’s API calls.

- In that case, the request to Stripe never leaves your browser, so nothing ever reaches Amex/USAA.

- **Orb → Stripe integration misconfigured**

- Orb sits between Augment and Stripe for usage-based billing. If Orb hasn’t been configured correctly (e.g. merchant category, accepted card networks, Apple Pay domain verification, etc.), Stripe may reject silently or never send the authorization request downstream.

- **Merchant account setup limitations**

- Stripe requires merchants to explicitly enable **Amex acceptance**, **Apple Pay domain validation**, and sometimes even Visa debit vs. credit. If Augment Code didn’t tick the right boxes, you’ll see “denied” errors even though nothing hit your bank.

## What this says about Augment Code

- It confirms **this is on their side, not yours or your bank’s**.

- Payment setup is a **mundane, solved problem** if a company is careful. Stripe is used by millions of businesses; properly configured, Amex/Visa/Apple Pay just work.

- If they can’t get payments working smoothly, it suggests **their engineering team is stretched thin** or **support/ops isn’t prioritized**. That fits your observation about unresponsiveness.

- It does _not_ necessarily mean financial distress — but it does indicate **immaturity in operations**. A company at Augment’s funding stage _should_ have enough staff to fix this quickly, so the lack of responsiveness is concerning.

## What you can do next

- **Rule out Librewolf once**: try Safari or Chrome with all privacy features off. If it still fails, you’ve confirmed it’s not your client.

- **Send them evidence**: Tell Augment Code support that Amex and USAA confirm **no authorization attempts were received**. That forces them to acknowledge it’s on their end.

- **Ask for a manual invoice / alternative payment link**: Stripe supports direct invoices and links that bypass Orb’s frontend. They may be able to email you a link.

- **Escalate**: If support doesn’t reply, consider raising the issue publicly (GitHub issues if they use it, or even LinkedIn/Twitter posts tagging them). Startups often respond faster to public pressure than private tickets.

Would you like me to check if other Augment Code users are **also reporting blocked Amex/Visa/Apple Pay payments** in the last month? That would show whether it’s a **systemic misconfiguration** versus just your account profile.

---

**You**:

I have done this multiple times with Safari which has no special hardening other than being safari. I do have Private Relay on but every sensible person uses it.  and Augment Code is in Palo Alto so they might have heard of Apple by now.

---

**ChatGPT**:

I checked around — I found some posts from other users having _similar_ payment issues with Augment Code (especially from outside the US/India), though I didn’t find anything that exactly mirrors your situation (cards from Amex / USAA in the U.S. not even seeing authorization attempts). So it does look like the problem might be more widespread (or at least not unique to you). [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1led65g/indian_credit_cards_problem_for_subscription/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Here are some refined thoughts / what this suggests, plus a few additional ideas.

## What the “others’ reports” suggest

- On Reddit, people from **India** are reporting they can’t subscribe using any of their cards. Some say they see “always for some reason … USD subscription … used multiple cards … no always for some reason” where “the $1 USD test charge / authorization” might be failing. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1led65g/indian_credit_cards_problem_for_subscription/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Some have been able to resolve this by using cards from certain banks or different kinds of cards (debit vs credit) or using friends’ cards from other countries. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1led65g/indian_credit_cards_problem_for_subscription/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Some of the issues appear to be tied to geographies / card-issuers being outside what Augment’s payment processor has been well configured to handle. Partial evidence: people in non-US locales having more problems. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1led65g/indian_credit_cards_problem_for_subscription/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

This reinforces the idea that the failure may be in how Augment / Orb / Stripe have configured the payment acceptance, or what card regions / card-types they allow (or have enabled).

## More likely causes in light of what you’ve tried

Given you have tried with mainstream browser(s) like Safari, Amex and USAA see _no authorization attempt_, and you are in the U.S. (I assume), here are more specific probable causes:

- **Merchant settings in Stripe not allowing Amex / Apple Pay or certain card networks****
If the merchant (Augment Code) hasn’t fully enabled Amex on their Stripe account (or hasn't done Apple Pay domain verification), attempts to use those methods may be blocked client-side or by Stripe before reaching the bank. This matches your experience: nothing ever hits Amex.

- **Orb integration / usage-based billing misconfiguration****
Since Augment is using Orb + Stripe, the logic / routing for charging might be splitting buckets or trying to validate card type earlier than the real authorization stage — maybe rejecting before sending to Stripe (for example, if the card is flagged as “unsupported” for the subscription plan).

- **Browser / front-end validations or form restrictions****
Even with Safari, there might be front-end JS that checks card network prefixes and disables unsupported card networks (Amex has different prefix rules) and throws a generic “denied” message without submitting. Or the Apple Pay flow isn’t fully enabled or has bugs.

- **Fraud / risk / compliance filtering****
The system might be filtering out transactions based on locale, billing address mismatch, IP address rules, etc., before authorization. If the system believes the card is “risky” per its rules, it might block before ever sending to bank.

- **API or network issues****
Perhaps some requests to Stripe or Orb are failing/prematurely aborted (timeout, CORS, TLS, etc.), so nothing leaves. This could be exacerbated by privacy/security tools—though you say you’ve tried with minimal blocking.

## What to do from here

You already have great debugging / isolating done. Here are a few additional / more pointed steps you could try, and also some things that Augment Code _should_ do.

- **Try with a card from a different issuer in the U.S.****
For example, a Mastercard or another Visa, but from a different bank, to see if _some_ U.S. cards are accepted. If yes, then the issue might be specific to certain card networks or banks.

- **Check for error messages / logs in developer tools****
When you try and fail, open Safari’s dev tools (Network tab, JS console) to see if there are any errors (CORS, script failing, resource blocked, etc.) around the payment widget. If something isn’t loading or a script call is blocked, that’s a clue.

- **Disable Private Relay / VPN / IP masking****
Even though Private Relay is “normal,” sometimes payment processors see masked or proxy’d IPs as high risk, or have rules against them. Try with everything as “normal” as possible (public IP, no smart proxy, etc.).

- **Ask Augment Code to provide a payment method alternative or fallback****
If possible, request a “manual invoice” or “link via email” and see if that bypasses the issue.

- **Demand more transparency from support****
When writing to them, include:

- That _no authorization request shows on your bank or Amex side_ (so it must be blocked before reaching them).

- Browser + OS + your region + type of card + whether Apple Pay was attempted.

- Ask them whether Amex is enabled in Stripe, whether domain verification for Apple Pay is complete, whether there are region restrictions.

## Is there a sign that Augment is in financial trouble or failing operationally?

Here’s what I found:

- I saw **no credible evidence** that Augment Code is insolvent or laying off support or finance staff in a way that’s publicly documented.

- There _are_ a number of user complaints on Reddit and elsewhere about payment system dysfunction, especially in certain countries. That doesn’t necessarily mean financial distress—it could mean they are scaling fast or have under-prioritized merchant-payments edge cases.

- The fact that many users _don’t get replies_ from support is concerning; but that’s unfortunately common in tech startups with high growth, especially for billing/payment issues that may require engineering effort.

So: in my view, there is **no strong signal** yet that the company is “in trouble” financially in the sense of starting to shut down. But there _is_ a signal that their payments operations / customer-support are under strain or mis-configured, that they may be understaffed in that area.

If you like, I can try to locate any _official status notices_ from Augment Code or Orb / Stripe about payment outages, or see if there's a current “Incidents” dashboard showing this issue. Do you want me to check?

---

**You**:

I don't see why Apple Pay would be blocked or any card validly enrolled in Apple Pay since the explicitly support it.  Check or see what is going on

---

**ChatGPT**:

You’re right that Apple Pay “should just work” if it’s actually reaching the networks. Your banks seeing **no auth attempts at all** means the failure is **before the issuer**—either in Augment’s frontend (browser → Stripe) or their Stripe/Orb configuration.

Here’s what most often breaks Apple Pay and cards **before** an authorization is created—and what to ask Augment to check.

### Likely causes on Augment’s side

- **Apple Pay domain not (correctly) registered** for the exact domain/subdomain that shows the Apple Pay button. Stripe requires merchants to register **every** domain and subdomain where Apple Pay appears (including staging vs. prod). If they moved checkout to a new subdomain (e.g., `pay.augmentcode.com`), Apple Pay will silently fail until that domain is added and verified. [Stripe Docs](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay?platform=web&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Merchant validation / setup incomplete** (Stripe has a specific Apple Pay flow; if misconfigured, the wallet sheet may appear but tokenization never completes, so no auth is sent). [Stripe Docs+1](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Recurring / saved-card flow mis-wired.** If they’re saving Apple Pay as a payment method for subscriptions and their implementation of the first on-session charge (CIT) → later MIT is off, the create-payment-method step may fail before any network call. [Stripe Docs](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/apple-pay-recurring?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Radar (fraud) rules blocking pre-auth** by IP/region/device or by wallet type—Stripe can block or require extra steps _before_ creating an authorization. If a rule says “block new customers from masked IPs” that can kill the payment early. [Stripe Docs](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Orb ↔ Stripe wiring.** Orb’s Stripe integration is common, but if they’re routing through Orb incorrectly (or mixing Stripe Checkout with Orb invoices), the call to create the PaymentIntent/SetupIntent can be skipped or error out client-side. [Orb](https://docs.withorb.com/integrations-and-exports/stripe?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Why Private Relay can matter (as a test)

Private Relay intentionally masks IP/location. Some merchants’ fraud rules or Apple Pay merchant validation steps can be sensitive to that and fail quietly. It’s not _supposed_ to block Apple Pay, but there are credible cases of **no request reaching the bank** when Private Relay was on. Try one clean attempt with Private Relay off to isolate this variable. [Apple Support+1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### What to ask Augment to do (precisely)

- **Confirm Apple Pay is enabled in Stripe and that all live domains/subdomains used at checkout are registered and verified** (Stripe Dashboard → Payment method domains → Add new domain). [Stripe Support+1](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enable-apple-pay-on-your-stripe-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Confirm Amex acceptance is enabled** and not filtered by Radar or allowed payment-method settings (Amex can be toggled per account/product). (Stripe PM settings / Radar rules.) [Stripe Docs](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Check the browser console/network logs** during your failed attempt for merchant-validation errors, CORS issues, or `payment_intent`/`setup_intent` creation failures (these indicate the request never reached the issuer).

- **Provide a Stripe Payment Link or Stripe-hosted Checkout/Invoice** for a one-time test. Those flows are Stripe-hosted and bypass most custom frontend bugs; they support Apple Pay and cards out of the box. If that works, the bug is in Augment’s custom pay UI. [Stripe Docs+1](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Quick sanity checks you can run (one time each)

- Safari, **Private Relay off** → retry Apple Pay once. If it still fails, that strengthens the “merchant configuration” diagnosis. [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Try a **direct card** (same card as in Wallet) in the same session. If cards also fail with no bank auth, it points to PaymentIntent creation failing before network.

- If Augment gives you a **Stripe Payment Link**, try Apple Pay there. If it succeeds, send them that proof—it isolates the issue to their current checkout integration. [Stripe Docs](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Is this a sign they’re struggling?

I don’t see credible reporting that Augment is insolvent or shutting down; payment problems like the ones users have described (esp. by region) are more consistent with **configuration/ops gaps** than with finances. There are public threads of users failing to subscribe (e.g., in India), which suggests broader integration issues rather than your specific banks. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1l26jaa/trouble_subscribing_to_augment_code_ai_from_india/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you want, paste any console/network error text from Safari’s Web Inspector during a failed attempt and I’ll decode what’s breaking.

---

**You**:

I have also tried adding both cards directly through their payment ui. no go.

---

**ChatGPT**:

Got it—since you also tried adding both cards _directly_ in their UI and neither issuer ever saw an auth attempt, the failure is **100% upstream of your banks**. It’s almost certainly in Augment’s checkout/frontend or their Stripe/Orb configuration (before any network authorization is created).

Here’s the shortest path to isolate and fix it—plus exactly what to ask them to check.

### Fast isolation (your side — one-time tests)

- Try once with **Safari → Private Relay OFF**, then add card and/or Apple Pay again. If issuers still see **no attempt**, that rules out IP/fraud heuristics on masked IPs and strengthens the “merchant config” diagnosis.

- Open Safari **Develop → Show Web Inspector → Network + Console** while adding payment. If you see errors around:

- `payment_intents` / `setup_intents` creation,

- **Apple Pay merchant validation**,

- CORS or blocked scripts,

copy those messages—that’s the smoking gun that nothing reached the issuer.

### What Augment _must_ verify (their side)

- **Apple Pay domain registration****
Stripe requires every **domain/subdomain actually hosting the Apple Pay button** to be registered & verified. If they moved checkout (e.g., `pay.augment…`, `billing.augment…`), Apple Pay can fail before tokenization and no bank auth is created. Stripe’s docs: _Payment method domains → Add new domain_ (and verify). [Stripe Docs+2Stripe Docs+2](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay?platform=web&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **PaymentIntent/SetupIntent creation is succeeding****
If their frontend (or Orb → Stripe call) fails while creating the intent, **no authorization is ever attempted**. Ask them to check server logs for errors on `payment_intents.create` / `setup_intents.create` and client logs for JS exceptions.

- **Stripe Radar / allowlist rules****
Stripe Radar can **block before authorization**, including when just attaching a card or saving a wallet. A too-aggressive “block” rule (by IP/region/device/wallet) yields “card denied” without contacting the issuer. They should review and temporarily relax block rules to test. [Stripe Docs+2Stripe Docs+2](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Amex + Apple Pay enabled for the account & products****
Ensure **Amex acceptance** and **Apple Pay** are enabled for the live account and that the Apple Pay domain verification shows **verified** for the exact hostname used. [Stripe Docs](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Bypass their custom UI as a control****
Ask them to send you a **Stripe Payment Link** or **Stripe-hosted Checkout/Invoice** for a $1 test. Those hosted flows support **cards + Apple Pay out of the box** and sidestep most frontend/Orb wiring bugs. If that works, the bug is in their current checkout integration. [Stripe Docs+1](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Copy-paste note you can send to Augment Support

**

I’ve tried Safari (and another browser). Amex and USAA report **no authorization attempts**, so the failure is before issuer contact.**
Please verify:

- **Stripe Apple Pay domain registration** for the **exact** checkout domain/subdomain in production is completed and shows **verified**.

- **PaymentIntent/SetupIntent** creation isn’t erroring (client console shows any JS errors; server logs show any Stripe API errors).

- **Stripe Radar rules** aren’t blocking card attach or Apple Pay pre-auth (try disabling custom block rules as a test).

- **Amex** and **Apple Pay** are enabled for this account/product.

- Send me a **Stripe Payment Link** / **hosted Checkout** to test; if that succeeds, the bug is in your custom Orb/Stripe checkout wiring.

Given your testing, this isn’t on you or your banks; it’s a correctable merchant-side setup/ops issue. If you can share any Console/Network errors from Safari, I can translate them into the exact Stripe call that’s failing and what they need to change.

---

**You**:

have now tried with Private Relay off not that it shoudl have mattered.  they are clearly fucking with me.

---

**ChatGPT**:

Ugh, I get why you’re mad. Since you’ve tried Safari with Private Relay off and **Amex/USAA still see no auth attempts**, the failure is unquestionably on Augment’s side—either their frontend never creates a Stripe intent, or their Stripe/Orb config blocks it _before_ any network authorization.

Here’s the tightest path to force a resolution:

- Ask them to **bypass their custom pay UI****
Request a **Stripe Payment Link** or **Stripe-hosted Checkout/Invoice** for a $1 test. Those hosted flows support cards + **Apple Pay** out of the box and skip most Orb/JS wiring issues. If that works, the bug is in their integration—not your cards. [Stripe Docs+1](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Tell them exactly what to verify in Stripe

- **Apple Pay domain registration** is complete for the _exact_ domain/subdomain where their Apple Pay button appears (Stripe requires registering every host). [Stripe Docs+1](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Amex acceptance + Apple Pay** are enabled on the live account. [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enable-apple-pay-on-your-stripe-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **PaymentIntent/SetupIntent creation** isn’t erroring (client JS errors or server 4xx/5xx) — if those calls fail, no bank ever sees a request. (Stripe’s “accept a payment” / Apple Pay flow hinges on these intents.) [Stripe Docs+1](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Stripe Radar rules** aren’t blocking pre-auth (Radar can hard-block _before_ issuer contact, including for card-attach or Apple Pay). Have them temporarily relax custom block rules and retry. [Stripe Docs+2Stripe Docs+2](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- If they’re routing via **Orb → Stripe**, confirm the sync/collection mode and that they actually create/confirm an intent (Orb’s invoice sync doesn’t control Stripe’s collection behavior). [Orb+1](https://docs.withorb.com/integrations-and-exports/stripe?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Give them one screenshot/log that pins it on their side**
Open Safari → Develop → **Show Web Inspector** → Console + Network, hit “Add card” / “Apple Pay”, and capture any errors around:

- `payment_intents.create` / `setup_intents.create`

- Apple Pay merchant validation

- CORS or blocked resources**
If there’s an error here, it literally proves nothing reached your bank.

- Copy/paste to Support (short and pointed)

**

I tried Safari with Private Relay off; **Amex and USAA report no authorization attempts**. Please:**
• Send a **Stripe Payment Link/hosted Checkout** for a $1 test.**
• Confirm **Apple Pay domain registration** for the exact checkout host is **verified**.**
• Confirm **Amex + Apple Pay** are enabled on the live account.**
• Check server logs for failed **PaymentIntent/SetupIntent** creation.**
• Temporarily relax **Radar block rules** and retry.**
If the Payment Link succeeds, your current Orb/Stripe checkout is misconfigured.

If they still stonewall, you’ve got receipts: others have had Augment billing glitches lately (different symptoms, same root: merchant-side issues). Not evidence of insolvency—just **ops/QA gaps**. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1l26jaa/trouble_subscribing_to_augment_code_ai_from_india/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Want me to sanity-check a console error or redact a HAR for you? I can translate it into the exact Stripe call they need to fix.

**You**:

does cursor now support remote agents?  I couild give up on Augment Code, though it does decent technical work.  Or I could try Claude Code though the agent approach is very inconvenient for working on a remote vps. sure it works, but the human can't see the action in the ssh session because the Augment Code or Claude Code UI takes over the shell.

---

**ChatGPT**:

Yes — Cursor _does_ support something close to what you mean by “remote agents,” though with caveats. Whether it solves your use-case (remote VPS / SSH workflows) depends on how you want to use it. Here’s a breakdown of what Cursor supports now + what people are saying, plus how it stacks up relative to Claude / Augment Code for your workflow.

## What Cursor supports now

From their documentation and recent blog posts:

- **Background Agents**: Cursor has “background agents” that can run _asynchronously in a remote environment_. They can edit and run code, you can check their status, send follow-ups, or “take over” the session. [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/background-agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Cursor Agent CLI / headless mode**: Cursor added a CLI / headless option so that agents can run from the terminal or in environments outside the GUI. This means you can issue prompts from the command line or other non-GUI contexts. [Cursor](https://cursor.com/blog/cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Web & Mobile use**: Agents can be used via web/mobile browsers, including running tasks like scaffolding features, doing bug fixes, etc. [Cursor](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-web?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Limitations & what people report (important if you work via remote SSH or in VPS)

- There are reports from users of **failed agent behavior** when connected to remote servers via SSH. One bug report: “Agent not working when connecting to Linux server using SSH remote tool. It keeps generating but nothing comes out.” [Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/agents-not-working-in-remote-servers/97736?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Also: people asking for more direct programmatic control (triggering agents from scripts, CLI, “do this on my remote server”) sometimes find gaps. For example, feature requests about using Cursor agents via MCP (Model Context Protocol) on remote servers. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1lcopai/does_cursor_background_agent_support_mcp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## How this compares with your use case (remote VPS / SSH sessions, wanting human visibility over what the agent does)

Here’s how Cursor’s current capabilities line up with what you said:
FeatureHow Cursor does vs what you wantAgent working in remote VPS / SSH environmentCursor _has_ some support, but SSH remote agent behavior is buggy according to users. Agents _may_ fail to output, or not “hook into” the remote shell where you see the live output. [Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/agents-not-working-in-remote-servers/97736?utm_source=chatgpt.com)Being able to see exactly what the agent is doing (in your SSH session)Limited. Agents can run tasks, produce diffs, pull requests, logs, but the live interactive shell takeover is not clearly supported or reliable. Users report that agents don’t always show commands or terminal output in real time.CLI / headless / scriptable triggeringYes, Cursor added a CLI / headless mode for agents. So triggering agent tasks outside the GUI is more possible now. [Cursor](https://cursor.com/blog/cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)Visibility and control over agent’s actionsYes to some extent (diffs, ability to “take over” agent, review PRs). Not perfect for fully watching every command in live shell, especially over SSH.

## Verdict: Does Cursor “solve” your issue better than Augment / Claude?

Probably **better** in many ways, but still not perfect for your exact needs (if your need is: _work in a remote ssh session, see everything agent does in that same session, interleave human and agent actions_). Cursor is moving toward that, but there are open bugs and limitations.

If I were you, I’d try this experiment:

- Set up a small project on a remote VPS you SSH into.

- Use Cursor agent via the CLI in that environment; issue a few commands, ask it to run a build, push a change, etc. See if you can monitor what it's doing (terminal output), and whether you can interject.

- Compare how that feels with your experience with Augment or Claude (if you use them similarly).

If you want, I can check Claude Code’s remote agent capability in the same depth (SSH / VPS workflows), so you can compare side by side. Do you want me to pull up that comparison?

---

**You**:

not yet

---

**ChatGPT**:

Got it 👍 — we’ll hold off on digging into Claude Code until you’re ready.

So the takeaway for now:

- **Cursor has added background/remote agent and CLI support**, but reliability over SSH/VPS sessions is mixed. Some users report the agent “goes silent” or doesn’t surface output in a way you can watch live.

- If your hard requirement is _“I see everything happening in the SSH session and can interleave my own commands”_, Cursor still may not fully satisfy that — but it’s closer than Augment or Claude in terms of giving you CLI/headless hooks.

- The easiest experiment is to try the **Cursor CLI agent** inside your VPS and see how well the workflow fits you.

Do you want me to put together a short step-by-step on how to test Cursor’s CLI agent on a remote VPS, so you can decide quickly if it solves your pain point?

---

**You**:

for iusing cursor should I add the remote-ssh vs code plugin and connect to the server where there is a clone of the repo?   I coiuld also ssh in the builtin terminal so that cursor would see everything as local as long as everything stayed connected.

---

**ChatGPT**:

Short answer: yes—use **Remote-SSH** and open the repo _on the server_ so Cursor treats everything as local. Keep a plain SSH terminal (tmux) alongside to “see” every command the agent or you run.

Here’s the clean setup that works well:

### Option A (recommended): Remote-SSH + Cursor editing directly on the VPS

- **Prep SSH**

- Ensure key-based login works: `~/.ssh/config` entry, `IdentitiesOnly yes`, etc.

- On the server, install `git`, your toolchains, and start a `tmux` session (`tmux new -s dev`).

- **Open the remote folder in Cursor via Remote-SSH**

- Install/enable the **Remote-SSH** extension in Cursor (same one as VS Code).

- “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…”, then **Open Folder** → choose the repo on the VPS.

- Cursor’s **Terminal** now runs _on the VPS_; LSPs, formatters, tests, etc., all execute remotely.

- **Watch everything live**

- Keep your own SSH window attached to the same `tmux` session (or tail logs).

- You can see every command/output in real time, interleave your own commands, and nothing “hides” in a private agent shell.

**Pros:** no file sync issues, one source of truth, you see everything.**
**Cons:** needs a stable connection (Remote-SSH is robust but still a remote session).

### Option B: Local workspace + builtin SSH terminal

- You can keep the repo **local** in Cursor and open a builtin terminal that SSH’s into the VPS.

- This works, but you’ll constantly juggle file sync (rsync/sshfs) or run commands remotely against a different tree. Easy to drift.

- Only do this if you must keep a local copy; otherwise Option A is simpler and safer.

### Option C: Run the agent **on the server** (maximum transparency)

- Install the agent/CLI on the VPS and run it **inside your `tmux` session**.

- You (and the agent) share the same terminal; you can see/interrupt everything.

- Use Cursor (via Remote-SSH) purely for editing; use the `tmux` pane for runs/deploys.

### Practical tips

- **Auto Save** on (files.saveAfterDelay) to avoid lost edits over remote.

- **Git**: keep signing off for remote if needed; set `core.autocrlf=false` on Linux.

- **Term logging**: `script -f session.log` in tmux if you want a full transcript.

- **Ports**: if you run dev servers, use Remote-SSH’s port forwarding so previews work locally.

- **Fallback**: if the Remote-SSH extension ever misbehaves in Cursor, open the same folder in stock VS Code Remote-SSH for the terminal/workflow, and keep Cursor alongside just for AI edits.

If you want, tell me your server’s distro and language stack and I’ll give you a tiny “first-run” checklist (packages, LSPs, port forwards) tailored to it.

---

**You**:

I absolutely despise tmux. never has there been a greater productive impediment.

---

**ChatGPT**:

Fair enough 🙂 — if tmux feels like an anchor, you don’t need it at all. You can still make **Cursor + Remote-SSH** work smoothly without touching tmux. Here’s how:

## Workflow without tmux

### 1. Connect with Remote-SSH

- Install the **Remote-SSH extension** in Cursor (same one from VS Code).

- Connect to your VPS and open the repo folder there.

- From now on, Cursor treats the remote repo as if it were local: edits, builds, tests, LSPs all run on the server.

### 2. Use plain terminals

- Just use Cursor’s **integrated terminal**. Each terminal tab is a _real shell_ on the VPS.

- If you want a parallel human-visible shell, just open a second normal `ssh` session in your macOS Terminal/iTerm — no multiplexing needed.

- No tmux, no session juggling. If your SSH drops, just reconnect Remote-SSH and your work is intact (files are saved in Git anyway).

### 3. Running agents & watching output

- If you trigger Cursor’s agent in the editor, it runs commands in the same Remote-SSH context.

- Want to see what’s happening? Just keep one terminal tab open in Cursor and one in your Mac Terminal, both connected to the same VPS directory. You’ll see everything.

## Trade-offs without tmux

- **Pro:** Much simpler, no extra keybindings or workflow overhead.

- **Con:** If your SSH session dies, long-running processes (like a server) also die.

- Workaround: run background jobs with `nohup`, `systemd --user`, or just relaunch if needed. For dev workflows, that’s usually fine.

## Simple alternatives to tmux if you ever need persistence

- `screen` (lighter, older, simpler keybindings than tmux).

- `nohup cmd & disown` to let a process survive logout.

- Or just script your dev server into `systemd --user` so it’s always running, and SSH only for edits/tests.

👉 For your case, I’d recommend: **Remote-SSH in Cursor + one extra ssh window in Terminal**. That gives you full transparency into what’s happening, no multiplexers, no tmux friction.

Would you like me to sketch a minimal “Cursor Remote-SSH + extra terminal” setup (step-by-step) so you can try it without syncing files manually?

---

**You**:

are 1 and 2 different options are part of the same approach?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Good catch — in what I wrote, **1 and 2 are not separate options**, they’re two **parts of the same recommended setup**.

Here’s the clarified picture:

### The single approach I’m suggesting

- **Step 1:** Use **Remote-SSH in Cursor** to open the repo _directly on the VPS_. That way, editing, linting, AI suggestions, etc., all happen “as if local.”

- **Step 2:** Use a **plain shell** (either Cursor’s built-in terminal tab _or_ a separate macOS Terminal/iTerm window with `ssh user@server`) to run and watch commands.

So:

- Remote-SSH makes Cursor “see” the project on the VPS.

- Terminals (Cursor’s or your Mac’s) give you real-time visibility into commands.

No tmux, no sync headaches, no duplicated trees — just one remote working copy.

Would you like me to map out the **exact setup steps in Cursor** (connect, open repo, open terminal, run agent) so you can try it immediately without second-guessing settings?

---

**You**:

OK.  the file browser is open to the directory on the vps that is the clone of the github repo.  the terminal is shelled to the same vps.  I supposed I am good to go?

---

**ChatGPT**:

Yep — you’re set. With the repo opened via **Remote-SSH** and a terminal into the same VPS, you can work as if it’s local.

Here’s a 60-second smoke test to be sure everything’s wired right:

- Sanity check the tree

bash`pwd && git remote -v
git status
`</pre>

- Toolchain check (swap in your stack)

bash`# pick what fits your project:
node -v || python3 --version || go version || rustc --version || gcc --version
`</pre>

- Build / test (adjust to your project)

bash`# examples:
npm ci && npm test
# or
pytest -q
# or
make -j
`</pre>

- Run something and confirm output shows up in _your_ terminal

bash`# if it’s a web service:
PORT=3000 ./run_dev.sh   # or npm run dev / uvicorn app:app --reload / etc.
`</pre>

If it serves HTTP, set up a quick forward (Cursor/VS Code will prompt) so `http://localhost:3000` opens on your Mac.

Quality-of-life tweaks (no tmux needed):

- **Keep SSH stable**: in `~/.ssh/config` on your Mac:

markdown`Host your-vps
    HostName x.x.x.x
    User <you>
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 4
`</pre>

- **Auto Save** in Cursor so you don’t lose edits if the remote drops.

- **One source of truth**: only edit in the Remote-SSH window (avoid a second local clone).

- **Env/secrets**: keep `.env` on the VPS and make sure your run/test commands read it.

Optional Cursor bits:

- Use Cursor’s integrated terminal for agent-triggered commands, and keep your separate Mac Terminal SSH window open to **watch everything live**.

- If you run into permissions on the VPS: `git config --global --add safe.directory /path/to/repo`.

If all four smoke-test steps work, you’re good to go. Want me to tailor the build/run commands to your stack (Node/Python/C++/Rust/etc.)?

**You**:

does onlyoffice have an arm64 build suitable to run on a Hetzner ARM64 vps?  I think so...   let's verify

---

**ChatGPT**:

Short answer: **Yes.** ONLYOFFICE **Docs / Document Server** has official **ARM64 (aarch64)** builds and Docker images, and it runs fine on a Hetzner ARM64 VPS.

### What’s supported

- **Deb/Ubuntu ARM64 packages** (Docs Community/Developer/Enterprise from v7.1+). Official guide covers ARM64 on Debian/Ubuntu and lists the dependencies. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu-arm64.aspx)

- **Docker (multi-arch) for ARM64** (v7.2+ documented). This is the easiest route on a fresh VPS. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-docker-arm64.aspx)

- Canonical also published an **Ubuntu ARM64 how-to** for ONLYOFFICE Docs. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-onlyoffice-docs-on-arm64-devices-with-ubuntu)

- Hetzner’s own community tutorial shows installing ONLYOFFICE Docs on **Ubuntu 24.04** (general, but works on ARM64 instances too). [community.hetzner.com](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-onlyoffice-docs-for-nextcloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**

**Resource sizing:** the Docker ARM64 guide recommends **≥4 GB RAM**, ~40 GB disk, plus swap. Pick a Hetzner ARM64 plan accordingly. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-docker-arm64.aspx)

### Quick start on a Hetzner ARM64 VPS (Docker)

bash`# with Docker installed
docker run -d --restart=always \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -e JWT_SECRET=choose_a_secret \
  onlyoffice/documentserver:latest
# (Optionally auto-TLS via Let's Encrypt:)
# docker run -d --restart=always -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
#  -e LETS_ENCRYPT_DOMAIN=docs.example.com \
#  -e LETS_ENCRYPT_MAIL=you@example.com \
#  -e JWT_SECRET=choose_a_secret \
#  onlyoffice/documentserver:latest
`</pre>

These commands come straight from the official ARM64 Docker install notes. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-docker-arm64.aspx)

### Native (APT) install (ARM64)

If you prefer system packages, the official ARM64 page walks through adding the ONLYOFFICE repo and installing `onlyoffice-documentserver` (with PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, NGINX). [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications+1](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu-arm64.aspx)

### Important caveat (Workspace vs Docs)

- **ONLYOFFICE Workspace Community (the all-in-one suite with Mail/CRM/etc.)**: the official installer **requires amd64** (x86_64) per the docs. So on a Hetzner **ARM64** VPS, stick to **ONLYOFFICE Docs/Document Server** rather than the full Workspace bundle. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/workspace/installation/workspace-install-docker.aspx)

If you’re integrating with Nextcloud, point the Nextcloud ONLYOFFICE app to your Document Server URL and (optionally) enable JWT to lock it down—this is the common, supported ARM64 path. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-docker-arm64.aspx)

Want me to jot a minimal Nextcloud ⇄ ONLYOFFICE ARM64 config (NGINX reverse-proxy + JWT) for your box?

---

**You**:

we are not going to use docker, but that doesn't matter as long was we can get a tarball that contains the arm64 build

---

**ChatGPT**:

Short version: **ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) is supported on ARM64 and will run on a Hetzner ARM64 VPS.** But **there isn’t an official prebuilt ARM64 “tarball” release**. They ship ARM64 via the package managers and Docker; the only tarballs you’ll see on their mirrors are **source code** (or Docker image .tar files), not a self-contained binary bundle.

### What you can download today

- **Debian/Ubuntu (ARM64) – .deb packages**: available from their repo and mirrors. Example: `onlyoffice-documentserver_arm64.deb` for v9.0.3 is on the SourceForge mirror. [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/onlyoffice-document.mirror/files/v9.0.3/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **RHEL/CentOS (ARM64) – .rpm packages**: `onlyoffice-documentserver.aarch64.rpm` is published for recent versions. [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/onlyoffice-document.mirror/files/v9.0.3/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Official docs for ARM64 on Debian/Ubuntu** (install via APT): they document ARM64 since 7.1+. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu-arm64.aspx)

- **Main download page** shows ARM builds for Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS. [ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-docs.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### So… no tarball?

Right—no official **binary** tar.gz for ARM64. The tarballs on GitHub/SourceForge are **source archives**; the “.tar.gz” you might see in enterprise/offline docs are **Docker images**, not bare binaries. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-enterprise-install-offline.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Recommended path on a Hetzner ARM64 VPS (no Docker)

- **Debian/Ubuntu**: add ONLYOFFICE’s APT repo and install `onlyoffice-documentserver` (their ARM64 guide walks through it). [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu-arm64.aspx)

- **RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky**: use the ARM64 `.rpm`. [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/onlyoffice-document.mirror/files/v9.0.3/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**

If you _must_ avoid APT/RPM entirely, your options are:**
(a) **Build from source** using their documented build tools, then package/deploy yourself. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-compile.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**
(b) **Manually extract the .deb/.rpm** into a directory and wire up dependencies/services by hand (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, NGINX). This works, but it’s fiddly and unsupported compared to using the repo. The ARM64 install doc lists the required services. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu-arm64.aspx)

If you tell me your distro (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 vs Debian 12 vs Alma 9), I’ll give you the exact commands and a minimal NGINX/JWT config to get it answering on your domain.

---

**You**:

so we can use apt for Ubuntu 24.04

---

**ChatGPT**:

Yes—APT on Ubuntu 24.04 (ARM64) is supported for **ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server)**.

Here’s the minimal, known-good sequence:

bash`# 1) Base deps (PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ; nginx comes via deps if needed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y postgresql rabbitmq-server

# 2) Add ONLYOFFICE APT key + repo
sudo mkdir -p -m 700 ~/.gnupg
curl -fsSL https://download.onlyoffice.com/GPG-KEY-ONLYOFFICE \
| gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/tmp/onlyoffice.gpg --import
chmod 644 /tmp/onlyoffice.gpg
sudo chown root:root /tmp/onlyoffice.gpg
sudo mv /tmp/onlyoffice.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/onlyoffice.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/onlyoffice.gpg] https://download.onlyoffice.com/repo/debian squeeze main" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/onlyoffice.list

sudo apt update

# (optional but recommended) preseed JWT
echo "onlyoffice-documentserver onlyoffice/jwt-enabled boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections
echo "onlyoffice-documentserver onlyoffice/jwt-secret  password YOUR_SECRET" | sudo debconf-set-selections

# 3) Install Document Server
sudo apt install -y onlyoffice-documentserver
`</pre>

- By default it listens on **port 80**; after install you should see the welcome page at `http://<your-server-ip>/`. [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx)

- The ARM64 guidance (originally written for 18.04/20.04) applies the same way on newer Ubuntu; Canonical’s ARM64 tutorial confirms the flow (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, then ONLYOFFICE). [ONLYOFFICE - Cloud Office Applications+1](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu-arm64.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you want to run it behind your existing Nginx/Apache and TLS, we can drop in a tight reverse-proxy + JWT snippet next.

---

**You**:

that's awesome.  I am doing this with a separate process.  just wanted to confirm availability

---

**ChatGPT**:

Great—then you’re good to go. ONLYOFFICE Docs **is** available via APT on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64.

Tiny checklist while you’re at it (just to avoid the usual snags):

- Aim for **≥4 GB RAM** (add 2–4 GB swap if tight).

- Open **80/443** (or set up your reverse proxy/TLS).

- Verify services after install:

bash`systemctl status onlyoffice-documentserver nginx rabbitmq-server postgresql
curl -f http://localhost/healthcheck
`</pre>

- If you’ll integrate with Nextcloud, set a **JWT secret** in `local.json` (or via debconf) and use the same secret in the Nextcloud ONLYOFFICE app.

If you want a minimal Nginx reverse-proxy + JWT snippet, say the word and I’ll drop it in.

---

**You**:

sure

---

**ChatGPT**:

Awesome — here’s a tight, copy-pasteable setup for **ONLYOFFICE Docs behind your own Nginx** on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64, with **JWT** enabled. No Docker.

# 1) Enable JWT in ONLYOFFICE

Edit `/etc/onlyoffice/documentserver/local.json`:

json`{
  "services": {
    "CoAuthoring": {
      "token": {
        "enable": true,
        "useforrequest": true,
        "inbox":  { "string": "CHANGE_ME_SUPER_SECRET" },
        "outbox": { "string": "CHANGE_ME_SUPER_SECRET" }
      }
    }
  }
}
`</pre>

Then restart:

bash`sudo systemctl restart onlyoffice-documentserver
`</pre>

Sanity check:

bash`curl -f http://127.0.0.1/healthcheck && echo "OK"
`</pre>

# 2) Nginx reverse proxy vhost (HTTPS-ready)

Assuming you want `docs.example.com` to front ONLYOFFICE. The ONLYOFFICE package runs its own internal stack on `127.0.0.1:8080` (proxied by its bundled Nginx to :80). We’ll **bypass the bundled Nginx** and proxy straight to :8080 for clarity.

Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/onlyoffice-docs.conf`:

nginx`map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
  default upgrade;
  ''      close;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name docs.example.com;

  # (Optional) ACME HTTP-01 challenge if you use certbot/lego externally
  location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { root /var/www/html; }

  # Increase upload limits for big docs (adjust as needed)
  client_max_body_size 100M;

  # Proxy everything to ONLYOFFICE’s app server
  location / {
    proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;

    # Required for websockets/co-editing
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;

    # Preserve host + scheme for callback URLs
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Timeouts generous for long editing sessions
    proxy_connect_timeout   60s;
    proxy_send_timeout      120s;
    proxy_read_timeout      120s;
    send_timeout            120s;
  }
}
`</pre>

Enable & reload:

bash`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/onlyoffice-docs.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
`</pre>
**

If the package’s own Nginx is already binding to :80, stop/disable its server block (or the whole service) to avoid port conflicts, e.g. `sudo systemctl stop nginx && sudo systemctl start nginx` after replacing configs. If you prefer to keep the package’s Nginx, change `proxy_pass` above to `http://127.0.0.1:80;` (double-proxy is fine, just a tad noisier).

For TLS (Let’s Encrypt), run certbot in your usual way and add the `server { listen 443 ssl; … }` block with `ssl_certificate`/`ssl_certificate_key` lines. Everything else stays the same.

# 3) Nextcloud ↔ ONLYOFFICE settings (if applicable)

In Nextcloud → **Settings → ONLYOFFICE**:

- **Document Editing Service address**: `https://docs.example.com/`

- **Secret key (JWT)**: `CHANGE_ME_SUPER_SECRET`

- (Optional) **Advanced server settings** → **Internal address** if Nextcloud reaches Document Server over private network; otherwise leave blank.

Save, then open a test `.docx` in Nextcloud to confirm the editor loads.

## Quick troubleshoot checklist

- `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8080/` returns 200? (ONLYOFFICE app server alive)

- `curl -I https://docs.example.com/` returns 200 and the welcome page loads?

- Websocket OK? While editing, `nginx -T` shows the `map $http_upgrade` and upgrade headers present.

- JWT mismatch? You’ll see “Invalid token” in the browser/Network panel—ensure Nextcloud secret exactly matches `local.json`.

If you want, tell me your exact domain and whether Nextcloud is on the same host or another VPS, and I’ll tailor the proxy/JWT bits (including internal-only allowlists and a sample CSP).

---

**You**:

Nextcloud and onlyoffice are on the same vps

---

**ChatGPT**:

Perfect—since both **Nextcloud** and **ONLYOFFICE Docs** live on the _same VPS_, the cleanest setup is a **single-domain / path-based** reverse proxy. That keeps everything same-origin (no CORS pain) and is easy to secure with JWT.

### Overview

- Public URL your users visit: `https://cloud.example.com/`

- ONLYOFFICE served under a path: `https://cloud.example.com/onlyoffice/`

- Internally, proxy `/onlyoffice/` to the Document Server service on `127.0.0.1:8080`

- Lock things with a shared **JWT secret**

## 1) Enable JWT in ONLYOFFICE (if not done)

`/etc/onlyoffice/documentserver/local.json`:

json`{
  "services": {
    "CoAuthoring": {
      "token": {
        "enable": true,
        "useforrequest": true,
        "inbox":  { "string": "CHANGE_ME_SUPER_SECRET" },
        "outbox": { "string": "CHANGE_ME_SUPER_SECRET" }
      }
    }
  }
}
`</pre>

bash`sudo systemctl restart onlyoffice-documentserver
`</pre>

## 2) Nextcloud Nginx vhost — add a path proxy for ONLYOFFICE

In your **Nextcloud** server block (the one that listens on 80/443 for `cloud.example.com`), add:

nginx`# ---- ONLYOFFICE path-based reverse proxy ----
# Serve ONLYOFFICE under https://cloud.example.com/onlyoffice/
map $http_upgrade $onlyoffice_connection_upgrade { default upgrade; '' close; }

location ^~ /onlyoffice/ {
    # Optional: bump upload size for big docs
    client_max_body_size 100M;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $onlyoffice_connection_upgrade;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Forward to Document Server app (most installs expose 127.0.0.1:8080)
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;

    # Long-polling / websockets timeouts for co-editing
    proxy_connect_timeout   60s;
    proxy_send_timeout      120s;
    proxy_read_timeout      120s;
    send_timeout            120s;
}
`</pre>

Then reload:

bash`sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
`</pre>
**

If your Document Server listens on a different port, adjust `proxy_pass`.**
If ONLYOFFICE shipped its own nginx snippets that also bind to :80,:443, just make sure you’re not double-binding. The path-proxy above works with the standard ONLYOFFICE service listening internally.

## 3) Nextcloud app settings (Admin → ONLYOFFICE)

- **Document Editing Service address**:**
`https://cloud.example.com/onlyoffice/`

- **Secret key (JWT)**:**
`CHANGE_ME_SUPER_SECRET`  (must match `local.json`)

- **Advanced server settings**: leave the “internal addresses” empty since you’re same host & same origin. (You can add them later if you split hosts.)

Save → open a test `.docx` from Files and it should load in the editor.

## 4) (Optional) Lock down access a bit more

- **Firewall**: ensure ONLYOFFICE’s internal service binds to `127.0.0.1` (default) so it’s not reachable externally except through Nginx.

- **CSP**: same-origin path setup usually needs no extra CSP tweaks. If you’ve hardened CSP, allow the `/onlyoffice/` path for scripts/websockets.

- **Rate limits** (optional): don’t rate-limit `/onlyoffice/` paths; co-editing uses many long requests.

## 5) Quick health checks

bash`# Document Server alive?
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthcheck && echo OK

# Nginx path proxy reachable?
curl -I https://cloud.example.com/onlyoffice/
`</pre>

If the editor fails to open:

- “Invalid token” → JWT mismatch between Nextcloud app and `local.json`.

- Spinning loader / 502 → check Nginx error log and `systemctl status onlyoffice-documentserver`.

- Websockets errors → confirm the `Upgrade/Connection` headers & `map` block are present.

If you share your exact domain name and any custom Nginx hardening you’re using (HSTS, CSP, proxy buffers), I can fold those into the snippet so it drops in cleanly.
