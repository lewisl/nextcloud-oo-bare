> since I still have Digital Ocean I'll just blow away the droplet that is there (since I've moved everything to Hetzner).  then I'll make a new bare droplet for testing all of this.  Anything special for that droplet to preinstall?  or just pick a distro and leave it bare so that snap does everything?

## Perfect Testing Strategy! Here's the Ideal Setup:

### For the Test Droplet, Keep It Minimal:

**Choose:**
- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (best Snap support)
- **2GB RAM minimum** (4GB better for Nextcloud + OnlyOffice)
- **50GB disk** (enough for testing)
- **Just the bare OS** - no pre-installed apps

### Initial Setup Commands (After Creation):

```bash
# 1. Update everything
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# 2. Install essentials for our project
apt install -y curl wget nano wireguard-tools

# 3. Install Docker (for OnlyOffice only)
apt install -y docker.io
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker

# 4. Install Nextcloud via Snap
snap install nextcloud

# That's it! Ready for testing
```

### Why Bare is Better:

1. **Clean slate** - No conflicts with pre-installed software
2. **Tests real deployment** - Exactly what you'll do on Hetzner
3. **Snap manages everything** - PHP, Apache, MySQL all handled
4. **Easier debugging** - Know exactly what's installed

### DO NOT Use:

- ❌ Docker or Docker Compose: extra layer of complexity
- ❌ Snap: installs server apps as standalone with redundant dependencies

### First Test After Setup:

```bash
# Verify Nextcloud is running
sudo snap services nextcloud

# Check if you can modify core files
ls -la /var/snap/nextcloud/current/nextcloud/lib/private/Encryption/

# Test WireGuard
wg version
```

This bare droplet will be perfect for:
1. Testing the WireGuard VPN setup
2. Verifying we can modify Nextcloud's PHP files
3. Testing the key server connection
4. Developing the patch script

Keep this test droplet until everything works, then replicate on Hetzner!
